1
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:40,892
<i>London in the 1960's. Everyone had
a story about the Krays.</i>

2
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:44,546
<i>You could walk into any pub to
hear a lie or two about them.</i>

3
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:48,922
<i>But I was there
and I'm not careless with the truth.</i>

4
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:54,613
<i>They were brothers, but bound by more
than blood. They were twins as well.</i>

5
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:59,789
<i>Counterparts. Gangster-princes
of the city they meant to conquer.</i>

6
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,225
<i>Ron Kray was a one-man London mob.</i>

7
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:06,983
<i>Bloodthirsty, illogical
and funny as well.</i>

8
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:09,397
<i>My Reggie was different.</i>

9
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:13,087
<i>Once in a lifetime do
you find a street fighting man like Reg.</i>

10
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:18,384
<i>Believe me when I say it took a lot of
love for me to hate him the way I do.</i>

11
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:31,810
Good morning, Albie.
Good morning, sir.

12
00:01:32,797 --> 00:01:35,005
Tea for two?
Yeah, Albie.

13
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:42,298
Hello, boys!

14
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:45,941
How you doing? You all right? Put
your cup of tea in, do you fancy it?

15
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:47,790
Yeah?
No?

16
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:51,831
What's this? The old Dagenham Angila?
Ought to

17
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:54,560
60 in .. what? 40 minutes
or sommit like that?

18
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:59,865
Cor, it's a bit of you in that, innit? All
black and cramped and very sharp. Yeah.

19
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,766
This one's really milky... for you.

20
00:02:02,865 --> 00:02:05,781
Why don't you fuck off, Kray?
Oh, I will, I will.

21
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:08,556
Y'know, I don't want to keep you,
you know, what with them... them,

22
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:11,005
y'know, rapists and murderers you
got to lock away, eh Nipper?

23
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:15,388
Where do you take a turd in there?
Probably just hold it in, don't you?

24
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,947
Alright, then, have a lovely day. Cheer up.
It's nearly Christmas.

25
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:23,410
Forget about that.

26
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:28,014
Where's me driver, where's Frank? He can't
get out of bed in the morning, Reg.

27
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:31,789
He what? He ain't here, he ain't showed up.
He's heart ain't in it.

28
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,934
Alright. OK, well let's
go get him then, should

29
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,762
we? Where is he? On
Ormsby Street, yeah?

30
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,164
Yeah, come and jump in.
I'll give you a lift. Nah, you're

31
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:40,243
alright, I'm going to walk. It's
a lovely day for it.

32
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:44,175
Don't forget this lot.
They're very important I won't.

33
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:49,104
Come on!
I shall walk incredibly slowly!

34
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,367
Hi, Vera. How you doing?
You good? Yeah. Lovely.

35
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,517
Rita, I was gonna knock on your door.
But me

36
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,180
mum said you left that
in her kitchen. I did!

37
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,389
Is that yours?
It is! Oh, thanks ever so much!

38
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,042
No problem, you're welcome.
Thanks, Reg.

39
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:12,152
Eastenders.

40
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:18,866
They won't talk to a policeman,
but they'll kiss a gangster. Ey?

41
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:21,588
Filthy, cockney bastards.

42
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,699
How about we clean your car for ya?

43
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:43,922
Is Frank about?

44
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:47,160
Frank!

45
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:54,351
Who are you?
I'm Frances. Frank's sister.

46
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:57,338
Hear about, I recognize you.
See, I recognize you. You was

47
00:03:57,231 --> 00:04:00,018
a little bit younger, then.
You got grown up, didn't ya?

48
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:01,771
It happens.

49
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:07,692
What have you got there?
A sweet.

50
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:12,237
That's not any sweet, is it? That's a Lemon
Sherbert, that is. Mind if I have a crack?

51
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:15,804
Go on.
Thanks.

52
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,036
Ah, that's nice, innit?

53
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:24,517
You're not supposed to chew it!
No?

54
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,343
How else am I supposed to
get to the sherbie bit?

55
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,617
By being patient.
Nah.

56
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:34,368
Being patient doesn't get
you what you want, does it?

57
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:39,368
Half a minute,
Reg. Be right down.

58
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:42,300
Is he in trouble?
Yea, he is.

59
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:47,368
Will you go out with me?
I'll go easy on him if you do.

60
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:53,285
Alright, but not for that reason.

61
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:55,096
Saturday night?

62
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,690
Who are you talking to?
You're half-dressed talking

63
00:04:57,616 --> 00:04:59,811
to a man in the door. What's
wrong with you, Frances?

64
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:03,565
Get back in the kitchen. Finish
them dishes. This is yours.

65
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:05,399
Thank you.

66
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:21,308
If you oversleep again, Frank,
alright? It's back to the cheese shop.

67
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:25,159
Or the fish shop, or whatever
shop it is you come from. Print.

68
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:27,259
Print shop.

69
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,558
Oh yeah? Well you'll be back to the
fucking shit shop, you understand? Yup.

70
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:34,733
What does your sister do?

71
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:38,412
Oh, she goes to one
of those, uh, Pitman

72
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:41,650
colleges. Y'know? Typing? Shorthand?
Yeah?

73
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:45,018
Well she's got a bit of class, mate.
She's

74
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:47,100
very elegant. Where have
you been hiding her?

75
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:51,842
She's been away.
She's a bit, umm, fragile, Reg.

76
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,065
Oh yeah?
Yeah.

77
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:58,061
Hmm.
Stop here, Frank.

78
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,214
Four minutes. One job.

79
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:13,255
How long do you think
it will take for him to

80
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:15,622
figure it, Albie?
A little bit of cat and mouse.

81
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:26,254
<i>Nipper Read was the copper on the Krays
case and he made his presence known.</i>

82
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:30,223
<i>He was heavy-footed, as they say.</i>

83
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,826
<i>So I stared at the back
of this geezer's head</i>

84
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:47,548
<i>and the whole time I'm thinking...
umm:</i>

85
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,012
Give Ron Kray your sausage.

86
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:59,702
Give Ron...

87
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:03,600
your fucking sausage.

88
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:07,209
Y'know?

89
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:12,079
I was drilling my eyes into
the back of his head...

90
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:18,915
Until I'm not even thinking it anymore.
I'm not even thinking.

91
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:22,543
I'm broadcasting it.

92
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:26,059
Until he turns around and you
know what he says? He says...

93
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:30,977
"Hey, Ron, do you fancy my sausage?
I've got no appetite for it."

94
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:33,952
Interesting.

95
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:37,737
<i>When my future brother in law
said 'interesting'...</i> Ain't it?

96
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:39,920
<i>It meant he had no
fucking idea what he, or</i>

97
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:41,723
<i>you or anyone else was
talking about.</i>

98
00:07:42,664 --> 00:07:44,288
Fascinating, Ron.

99
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,771
Fascinating.

100
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:52,451
<i>Ron had been sentenced to three years in
prison for grievous bodily harm.</i>

101
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,991
<i>Near the end of his
sentence, he was certified</i>

102
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:57,110
<i>insane and remanded to a
mental hospital.</i>

103
00:07:57,412 --> 00:07:59,984
<i>What was wanting was a
friendly psychiatrist.</i>

104
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,074
Roger, when you say you want
me to raspberry this man...

105
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:07,569
I'm not sure of your vernacular.
What do you mean?

106
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:12,736
Raspberry ripple. Cripple.-
You want to cripple someone.

107
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,545
Yup.
That's right- And why is that?

108
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:20,066
Because, doctor, I'm afraid
he may not be inclined...

109
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:25,615
to provide a favorable evaluation to
my employer. And who is your employer?

110
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,400
Ronnie Kray.

111
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:31,718
Is there hope, Doctor?

112
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,193
Excuse me a moment.

113
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:39,547
Take your time.

114
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,382
Ronald Kray possesses
possibly the soundest mind

115
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,421
I've seen in 26 years in
psychiatric practice.

116
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,660
In my view, to keep him here would
be a waste of public resources.

117
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:02,083
A lifetime's integrity down the toilet.

118
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,337
<i>The Queen would survive,
but God save the rest of us.</i>

119
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,157
Mr. Kray?

120
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:16,712
I hope you know what you're doing.
Yeah, I know what I'm doing. I'm

121
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:18,928
going back to London. I'm going
to take the... take the car...

122
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:23,787
Your brother has no real idea who or what
he is. Nor does he trust his own senses.

123
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:26,901
I've never seen a man
so desperately in need of reassurance.

124
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,970
We all like a nice little
compliment now and again, don't we?

125
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:31,512
Your brother is arbitrary,
violent and a psychopath.

126
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:33,502
Alright. Probably
paranoid schizophrenic.

127
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:38,570
What I'm trying to tell you is
that he's off his fucking rocker.

128
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,403
It's called Stemetil. You need
to give it to your brother

129
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,058
twice a day, or there's going
to be serious trouble.

130
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:55,495
<i>Oy Frances, the car is outside.</i>

131
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,035
Oh, heh, You've got glamour, Frances.
You're like an East End starlet.

132
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:10,265
East End harlot's more like it.

133
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,874
They're trousers, mum.
She doesn't look like a harlot.

134
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,471
What she's wearing doesn't matter.

135
00:10:14,503 --> 00:10:17,754
When people see her with Reggie Kray,
they'll think she's a tart.

136
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:23,292
Why would you say that? He's a gangster,
Frances. The Krays are gangsters.

137
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:25,382
Well, I think he's sweet.
Oh, God.

138
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:29,404
And I'm going to kiss him, you hear me?

139
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:35,638
Hello.
Hello.

140
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:42,354
You look lovely.

141
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:45,083
And so do you.

142
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,726
Hello. This is Big Pat. Hello, Bit Pat!
Reggie.

143
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:04,196
How are you doing, you all right, mate?
You all right? Nice to see you.

144
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,449
Big Pat's here to keep the riffraff out.

145
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,008
Always. So how come you're
letting us in, then, mate?

146
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,174
Have a good night.Thanks.
Thanks, mate. Cheers.

147
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:15,345
Oh hello, here's trouble. Hold the phone.

148
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:18,150
Who are you?
How you doing, big man?- All right, boss?

149
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:20,259
Are you well?
Yeah, I'm fame... I'm fame...

150
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:21,663
Are you behaving yourself?
Always.

151
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:23,340
I'm a teddy bear, me.
Go easy.

152
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,142
If he gives you any trouble, come and
speak to me Come. Y'alright, mum

153
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:28,154
Yeah, I'm good. She's good.- Hello, Reg.

154
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,790
Everybody here knows you.
Yeah, well, I own it. It's my club.

155
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,822
You mean it's your local?
No, I own the place. It's mine.

156
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:40,116
I've been by here ten times.
I never knew it was yours.

157
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,411
Well, you can get away with a lot in life
if you, uh... keep your mouth shut.

158
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,143
That's Teddy Anderson, now.

159
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:49,493
Hi, Teddy. You doing alright? Good to
see you. How's the family? Excellent.

160
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:52,945
What?
Those men are frightening.

161
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:54,918
No, no. They're just East End boxers.
They're

162
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,106
lovely. I let 'em drink
in here for free, y'know.

163
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:00,970
Reggie, that's Joan Collins.
Yeah, it might be, yeah. We had

164
00:12:00,897 --> 00:12:03,600
that... that... Barbara Windsor
in here the other night.

165
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,349
Really? Yeah, she comes in here
quite a bit actually. She loves it.

166
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:09,222
And uh... That's my... my formula.
What I like to do is I like

167
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:12,060
to mix celebrities with a few,
just a few, East End villains.

168
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:15,974
Y'know, punters, they love it. It's really
good for business. Would you like a seat?

169
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:20,255
Excuse me, Reg. Do you, uh, got a moment?
No, I don't. That's it. I'm busy. Alright?

170
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:23,329
This is important, Reg.
And this is important as well, Reg.

171
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,544
Alright, alright. Frances,
would you mind if I,

172
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:30,167
uh, take care of some
business just for a moment?

173
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:32,694
No, of course not.
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

174
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,495
Sit with her.
What is it?

175
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:35,875
It's back here.
What?

176
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:38,764
I'm a firm believer in
the fact if you don't

177
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:40,801
know, you don't fucking know.
Know what I mean?

178
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,204
Reggie.
How are you, Reg?

179
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:50,607
Well, I'm alright, I can't complain.
Who'd fucking listen?

180
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,264
What is the palaver? Sit down, Reg.
Sit down, please.

181
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:56,080
Alright.- You had a question
about the taking of the

182
00:12:56,014 --> 00:12:57,923
purple heart business.
Yeah. The pill game... Go on.

183
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,904
Jack here would like to explain himself.
Go on.

184
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:03,206
Go on, Jack. Tell Reggie what you told me.

185
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:08,469
Well, Reg...
Yeah?

186
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,896
I, uh... thing is, under normal
circumstances... my accountants...

187
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:17,718
Are you gonna take all fucking night, mate?
Cos I've got things to do.

188
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,442
Tell him, Jack.
Go on, spit it out.

189
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:24,396
I borrowed a few quid off the top.
Right, alright.

190
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,811
I swallowed a few pills on the side.-
Yeah, there's a simple answer.

191
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,686
Things have been a bit... tight at home

192
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:31,414
And I was... was just trying to keep the
wife happy.- Trying to keep the wife happy.

193
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:34,701
Is this what you brought me in here? For
this?- It's important.- This nonsense.

194
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,046
It's important business.
It's important, is it? Yeah.

195
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,847
You should know about this. Right,
alright Let's deal with this business.

196
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:41,599
Alright, tomorrow you
come back to work, yeah?

197
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:43,312
And you pay back every
fucking penny you owe.

198
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,966
Do you understand?
I was gonna suggest that.

199
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:48,389
Good. Right. Are we done? Everybody happy?

200
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,583
Alright then. Can I get
back to my fucking evening?

201
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:53,909
Thank you. Thank you very much, Albie.
Cheers.

202
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:56,725
Sorry for wasting your time, Jack.
Thanks.

203
00:13:56,772 --> 00:14:00,060
Thanks for coming in. Here you go, mate.

204
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:03,973
Good?

205
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:08,487
Fucking, thieving cunt. You understand...
Get him a tissue.

206
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:13,112
With me? Yeah? Next time I'll
finish you off, you little slag.

207
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,323
Get him out of here. Go
on, Fuck him off. Fuck!

208
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:17,471
Are you fucking off. What did you say?

209
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:20,388
Don't you swear in my club.
Get him out of here right now.

210
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:22,969
Don't swear in my club, you wanker.

211
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:25,372
Now listen, there's something else.
No, there isn't something else,

212
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:27,340
alright, cos I've got a young lady
in here, and I'm entertaining.

213
00:14:27,414 --> 00:14:28,876
Yeah, but this is...
Lookit.

214
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,589
See that, there? I see
it. I'm entertaining.

215
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,359
Alright? So I'm gonna have
an evening to myself.

216
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:35,192
This is important business.
Can't be. My business, innit?

217
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:37,053
It's my business. I would know.

218
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:38,748
G'night, Albie.

219
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:44,659
Hello. Did I miss anything important?

220
00:14:44,788 --> 00:14:48,168
No, just me.
That? That is important.

221
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:50,194
Is it?
Very important.

222
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,307
Thank you.
Thank you.

223
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:55,246
Fuck off!

224
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,571
So uh, your brother told me that you uh...
you're going to college.

225
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:05,548
Right? To... to study... to be a secretary.
Is that right?

226
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,422
Yeah, anything to get out of the East End.
Oh, what's so bad with the East End?

227
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:14,540
I've just got bigger dreams than pushing
pram or having it with the butcher.

228
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:20,510
I just don't quite know what they are yet.
East End is not that bad.

229
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:23,345
The center of the earth
could be anywhere you like.

230
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:25,761
Even here?
Yeah, even here.

231
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:28,297
In Bethnal Green?
Yeah, in Bethnal Green.

232
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:33,103
Do you like being a gangster?

233
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:43,716
I'm not a gangster.
I'm a club owner.

234
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:50,503
I like the money and I like the
respect of being a club owner.

235
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:52,451
I'm not a gangster.

236
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:58,998
I could've been a boxer,
y'know, but then ya... hello, mate.

237
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,015
I'd end up looking like
some sort of potato and I

238
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,011
wouldn't even know what
day of the week it was.

239
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,923
This way at least I know who I am.

240
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:09,420
I also know that I've made a
little bit of something of myself.

241
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,296
I don't owe the world anything.

242
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:15,868
So long as the world agrees with you.

243
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:19,050
I think the world will be alright.

244
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:34,721
<i>We shall fight on the beaches
. We shall fight on the landing grounds.</i>

245
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:38,409
<i>We shall fight in the fields
and in the streets.</i>

246
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:42,756
<i>We shall fight in the hills. We shall
never surrender. And if...</i>

247
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:45,258
Ronnie.

248
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,068
Ronnie, come on out.
You've got visitors, mate.

249
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,806
Watch your step, it's a bit wet.

250
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:55,610
Cor, you alright?
Mmm hmm.

251
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:59,222
You must be Frances.
Hi.

252
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:01,954
Yeah?

253
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,317
Hello, Frances. Hello. Welcome
to the family. Well, that

254
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:08,487
is a bit premature, though, isn't it?
*laughs nervously*

255
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:11,796
Hey, you don't have a
beer that I can have, do

256
00:17:11,753 --> 00:17:13,123
ya, Ron?
Yeah, of course I do, help yourself.

257
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:15,047
Right. Don't mind if I have a beer, do ya?

258
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,428
I'll let you get to know each other.

259
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:22,922
Want a cup of tea? I just put a kettle on.
Take a seat. Go on.

260
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:25,091
Sit down anywhere you like.

261
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:30,456
Ey, needs a bit of warming up. So.

262
00:17:31,356 --> 00:17:32,729
What do you think?

263
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:37,440
Do you think that we look alike?
Me and Reggie?- Oh yes, certainly.

264
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,692
No you don't. You think that he's beautiful
and I've got a face like a gorilla's ass.

265
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:46,272
No. - It's alright, don't worry about it.
I'm used to it.

266
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:48,286
<i>Stop doing your hair, right.
Get your stuff out</i>

267
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,014
<i>of the car. Do something
fucking useful.</i>

268
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:54,897
Go on, go away.

269
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:01,903
I'm a homosexual, Frances.

270
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:07,539
Well, ya know, I am uh,
y'know... I'm a giver.

271
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:10,159
Alright? I'm not a receiver.
There is a difference.

272
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:11,717
I'm not a faggot.

273
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:15,994
But I do believe that, y'know, you
should not hide what you are.

274
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,531
Ya shouldn't hide what you
are, because it makes

275
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:20,997
you very... very sad, y'know?
Make you very sad.

276
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,689
Make you very unwell.
I agree completely. Mmm hmm.

277
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:28,976
You know me and my brother?
We're gonna rule London.

278
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,456
<i>The Kray's main rivals were the
Richardsons of South London.</i>

279
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:38,415
<i>They were called the Torture Gang.</i>

280
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:41,444
For the benefit of the jury...

281
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:45,577
On whose behalf were you operating
on this side of the river?

282
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:48,207
Come on, Charlie. Please, I'm
begging you... Oh, no no no no.

283
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,668
You do business with the
court as an entity,

284
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:52,831
therefore address the
court.- What?- What?

285
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:55,090
Your honor.
Fuck!

286
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:59,187
You say 'Your Honor'. By saying Your
Honor, you gain the court's attention...

287
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:02,313
and open up a channel of communication.
A conduit.

288
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:03,957
So, we'll try again.

289
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:06,913
For the benefit of the
jury: On whose behalf

290
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,469
were you working on
this side of the river?

291
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:11,304
Please, Charlie. I fucking beg you...

292
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:16,324
Order! Order in this, my court.
Oh, fuck!

293
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,781
You're in Indian Country, old son.

294
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,952
That's what them Cockneys call
south of the river, innit?

295
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,545
Indian Country.

296
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:33,466
Well? What you doing on my
reservation without my say-so...

297
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:36,606
filling up your canteen from
my fucking watering hole?

298
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,636
You ain't got the balls to
do that on your own, son.

299
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:40,248
Who do you work for?
I don't know what you're on about,

300
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:41,688
Charlie. I don't know what
you're on about... Charlie!

301
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:43,863
Say it. Say the name.
Say it!

302
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:46,078
Buzz him.

303
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,274
Objection, Your Honor.
My client is an upstanding citizen.

304
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:51,655
Objection overruled on
the grounds it's boring.

305
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,992
Oh well, fuck him.

306
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:58,737
Say it.
Say the Krays, you daft cunt.

307
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:01,402
No, no. No leading the witnesses!

308
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,357
Fuck off!

309
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:32,838
Alexander might have been
great, but he wasn't Greek.

310
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:36,600
No?
No, he was a Macedonian.

311
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:40,410
But he loved them, though.
Aristotle and that lot. He

312
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:43,089
was deeply impressed by them
flash Hellenistic cunts.

313
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:45,924
Kristos, get us some more
of that awful Retsina.

314
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,484
Charlie, we've got to fucking sort this.

315
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:03,325
You're absolutely right.
Kristos, where is my Retsina?

316
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:06,803
<i>The Richardsons sent George Cornell
to call for a truce.</i>

317
00:21:06,823 --> 00:21:09,433
<i>All they were saying was:
"Give peace a chance".</i>

318
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:10,848
Fucking Frank 'll 'ing.

319
00:21:12,385 --> 00:21:15,396
Oh, fuck. Are you out of your bravery
jacket? We're here to parlay.

320
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:18,365
I will fucking map you up, southie.

321
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:21,222
Oh no, no, Gordon. Let him
in, he's only little.

322
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,541
Things have got out of hand.
Charlie wants to meet.

323
00:21:24,588 --> 00:21:29,052
Pig and Whistle. Neutral ground.
Just him, you two and Eddie.

324
00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:31,783
Yup? And how do we know
that we're gonna be safe?

325
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:36,378
Well... that's a little thing
called trust, ain't it?

326
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:40,943
Trust, eh? You always got one bloke...
harping on about trust, don't you?

327
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:43,415
But then ya look over your shoulder, right?
And you see there's

328
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:45,917
another bloke there, right? There
with his hampton in his hand...

329
00:21:45,877 --> 00:21:48,772
and he's preparing to shove
his cock right up your ass.

330
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:50,951
Well, you wouldn't mind, eh?

331
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:53,819
You fag puff.

332
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:03,946
Well, no. No no no no no. Right,
you, get him out of here.

333
00:22:03,827 --> 00:22:06,621
Go on, fuck off. One hour...
and we'll be with ya.

334
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:10,077
I said bye bye.- Fuck off, John.
There's the door, go on.

335
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:13,871
Bye bye.- Take that fox with ya, go on.
Get out, ya prick.

336
00:22:14,856 --> 00:22:16,257
A fucking limited.

337
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:21,565
Hey Charlie, please can I have another egg?
I've eaten this one.

338
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,348
I don't like it, Reggie.

339
00:22:24,128 --> 00:22:27,891
Nah, it's alright. I know
them and I know their pub.

340
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:30,193
We'll be alright.

341
00:22:30,197 --> 00:22:33,200
Man, you've got to clean that
fucking toilet, mate. It stinks!

342
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,002
Who am I gonna pay to do it?
Some mofo when she

343
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,695
don't? What are you
having to drink?- Ummm...

344
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:38,475
Forget it, they just walked in.

345
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:42,136
Hello, mate. Can I get two
Guinnesses, please? Yeah,

346
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:44,349
hang on a sec, just gotta go
down to change the barrel.

347
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:56,171
Reg? Ron? The Richardsons were unexpectedly
engaged, so we're gonna look after you.

348
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,800
Oh, it's alright .. yeah, the landlord is
gonna change the barrel for me, thanks.

349
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:01,695
You don't mind if I pour
myself a pint, yeah?

350
00:23:01,822 --> 00:23:05,549
What is that? Yeah, what you think, puff?
It's a fuckin' tool.

351
00:23:05,463 --> 00:23:09,175
No, it's not. It's a fuckin' rolling pin.
Who are you? Fanny Cradock?

352
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:11,573
What are you doing with that? Are
you going to bake me a cake?

353
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:13,924
Gonna sing me a song and watch
me blow out me fucking candles?

354
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:21,635
I come here for a fucking shootout, right?
A proper shootout with some proper men.

355
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:24,970
Like Colonel Custer and Geronimo.
Have you ever heard of them? No.

356
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:28,541
Because you were too in your penny
baking fucking fairy cakes weren't ya?

357
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:33,285
Reg, this lot is a bunch of fucking
nonces to a man. They're fucking nonces.

358
00:23:33,271 --> 00:23:35,731
Get out of me fucking way.
Go on, get out. Go on,

359
00:23:35,642 --> 00:23:37,966
fuck off. You call yourself
a fucking gangster?

360
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:41,161
A shootout, right? Is a fucking shootout!

361
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:46,709
Like a Western.

362
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:55,392
Wankers! Fucking embarrassing. Waste
of my time. Fucking waste of time.

363
00:23:58,081 --> 00:24:00,696
Well, your brother has done a runner.
Nah, he's

364
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:03,227
just genuinely disappointed
with you, that's all.

365
00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:07,408
Look at that, it's full
of iron, that is. It

366
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:10,035
takes a while, that
does, yeah, to settle.

367
00:24:10,722 --> 00:24:13,893
Well, Charlie Richardson said we're
to knock the granny out of you, Reg.

368
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:16,805
Oh yeah, he did, did he? That's
good of him. Right, listen.

369
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:22,220
When you see him next, you
tell him for me, yeah, that I say:

370
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:25,835
Fuck Charlie, right? And
fuck his brother, yeah?

371
00:24:25,753 --> 00:24:28,564
And fuck that fat Georgie Cornell
that hangs out with him.

372
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:31,698
Fuck your face, yeah? Yeah?

373
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,108
And fuck the fucking lot of you as well.
What do you think of that, ey?

374
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:36,501
You like that?- mmm.

375
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:40,971
You won't mind if I fight back, will ya?
If you think you can manage it.

376
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:43,615
Nah, it's more for me pride,
really, to be honest.

377
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,705
I warn you. I'm not gonna
fight fair, though.

378
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:48,242
That's why I brought these.
Alright.

379
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:52,200
Now before we start, I've got a little
joke for you? You're gonna love this one.

380
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:55,273
Paranoid schizophrenic
who walks into a bar...

381
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:25,597
You fuckers...

382
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:43,733
<i>They never stood a chance against
my beautiful Reggie.</i>

383
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:48,225
<i>A gang war seemed certain.</i>
Fucking hell, Ron.

384
00:25:48,156 --> 00:25:52,235
<i>But on the day of the World Cup final,
Scotland Yard had its say as well.</i>

385
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:55,403
<i>There's Ball, running himself daft.</i>

386
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:01,920
Goooaaal! Get in there, you cunts!

387
00:26:02,768 --> 00:26:05,411
Police, stay right where you are.
Oh, come on,

388
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,700
boys... not today.
What you mean, no goal?

389
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:10,015
Wait.
Wait wait wait. Wait!

390
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:15,410
It's a goal. It's a goal! It's
a fucking goal! It's a goal!

391
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,720
<i>Charlie Richardson was
sentenced to 25 years</i>

392
00:26:23,585 --> 00:26:26,262
<i>for fraud, extortion and assault.</i>

393
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:30,693
<i>London was an open city
and the Krays moved in.</i>

394
00:26:38,218 --> 00:26:41,389
Glad you could come, Mr. De Faye.

395
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,068
Mr. Payne.

396
00:26:45,694 --> 00:26:49,073
I'm not often intrigued,
but your message...

397
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:50,872
it intrigued.- mmmm.

398
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,069
Sit down.

399
00:26:54,978 --> 00:26:57,064
These are the Kray twins.

400
00:26:57,802 --> 00:26:59,779
Ronald and Reginald.

401
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:07,721
Yes, I've, uh... heard of them.
You'll find them useful friends.

402
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:11,353
What is this about, Mr. Payne?
This is about a gambling

403
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:14,184
casino in Knightsbridge
called Esmeralda's Barn.

404
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,183
I'm not familiar with it.
Really?

405
00:27:16,424 --> 00:27:19,406
Well you'll be shocked
to learn that you earned

406
00:27:19,296 --> 00:27:22,352
24,000 pounds from it in
the last three months.

407
00:27:22,428 --> 00:27:24,835
My friends and I would
like to purchase it from

408
00:27:24,748 --> 00:27:27,418
you. We have the contract
ready for your signature.

409
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:33,508
<i>Ruling London involved intelligence
and intimidation.</i>

410
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:34,971
It's not for sale.

411
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:40,885
You might find that in the future
there is a less polite approach.

412
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:43,710
<i>The trick was to cultivate
a quiet certainty that</i>

413
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:46,295
<i>should it be needed violence
was on offer...</i>

414
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,883
Yeah...- <i>, and would be happily applied.</i>

415
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:52,198
<i>Leslie Payne was a fronter and a fixer.</i>

416
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:56,363
<i>Reggie found Payne useful,
but Ron was suspicious of him.</i>

417
00:27:56,357 --> 00:28:00,485
<i>Afraid his scams were the opposite
of what a gangster should be.</i>

418
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,806
Consider Las Vegas.
Right.

419
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,662
It is all legal and all run by the mafia.

420
00:28:05,722 --> 00:28:09,682
Soon, London will be the same. What with
Havana gone, the mafia is moving in.

421
00:28:09,682 --> 00:28:13,951
Meyer Lansky has already made inquiries.
Meyer Lansky? Yeah.

422
00:28:14,603 --> 00:28:16,481
As in the Meyer Lansky?

423
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:18,151
Meyer Lansky.

424
00:28:19,485 --> 00:28:22,472
What, the Americans gonna try muscling us?
Nah, they don't work that way.

425
00:28:22,374 --> 00:28:25,825
They don't want a war, Ron.
They're businessmen.

426
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:27,346
Well, maybe I want a war, anyway.

427
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:32,495
Now look, what they do want is to know
who is the up and coming local firm.

428
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:36,924
Cos they will colonize London by financing
that firm and franchising the city.

429
00:28:36,771 --> 00:28:40,642
So you have to prove to the Americans
that the Krays are the only gang in town.

430
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:42,672
Yeah, very fucking interesting.

431
00:28:43,531 --> 00:28:47,942
The world could be our oyster.
Payne. What?

432
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:50,689
You say "our" a lot, right?

433
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:56,184
You say 'our' and you also so 'we' a lot.

434
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:57,749
Do I?

435
00:28:58,098 --> 00:29:01,601
My question is... is your last name Kray?

436
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:07,988
Listen, Ron. You keep the pearls.
I'm perfectly happy with the soft bits.

437
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,847
Yeah, I bet you are. I bet you are.

438
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:17,322
Reggie, I say it's a very bad idea, this.
It's a bad idea.

439
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:21,204
I say, right, that we meet these mafioso
scum at London in a pub, right.

440
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:23,793
We pick them up, we chop them up.
We put them in their

441
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:26,002
fucking luggage and send
em straight home away.

442
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:28,534
That's the plan.

443
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:39,610
Well, I'm glad we could have this meeting.

444
00:29:40,436 --> 00:29:43,833
Mr. Lansky has taken an interest
in the Colony Sporting Club.

445
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:46,301
He has his casino people there right now.

446
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:52,561
Well, Mr. Lansky might want to know that
we happen to have a casino of our own.

447
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:55,247
Really? Your own casino?

448
00:29:55,946 --> 00:29:58,169
Well, you see, we own Las Vegas.

449
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,291
But here the Atlantic Ocean is in our way.

450
00:30:02,347 --> 00:30:04,971
So Mr. Lansky lacks
the ability to, uh,

451
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:07,841
ensure the physical
security of his property.

452
00:30:07,978 --> 00:30:11,148
From both outside muscle... and the cops.

453
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:16,441
He thinks the Kray family can help. London
is going to be the Las Vegas of Europe.

454
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:20,127
We need someone to front and
someone to muscle for us.

455
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:24,484
I mean, y'know, we can do
your security, that's not

456
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:27,498
a problem. Y'know, but we
don't wanna work for ya.

457
00:30:28,013 --> 00:30:30,449
We'd much rather that we work with ya.

458
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:32,747
What Reggie's trying to say...
I think he

459
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:35,161
knows what he's trying to say.
He just said it.

460
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:40,385
We're in your backyard.- Yeah.- Mr. Lansky
is open to discussions of this nature.

461
00:30:40,249 --> 00:30:45,810
He sends this as goodwill gesture. Just
a taste. For expenses. Open it, please.

462
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:57,684
Now, the second briefcase contains business
of my own I need to take care of. Please.

463
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,056
Bearer bonds. Free money.

464
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:07,653
A hundred grand in negotiable bearer
bonds jacked from a bank in Montreal.

465
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:10,406
Too hot to move in North America.

466
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:15,209
It's a hundred grand.
Could you guys handle that?

467
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:18,743
Yeah, we can handle it.

468
00:31:19,354 --> 00:31:21,357
Really? Good.

469
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,853
Boys who jacked it get 20%.
We split the rest 60/40.

470
00:31:26,715 --> 00:31:31,839
If this works out, Reggie, I got a two
million dollar backlog of those scharols.

471
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,629
Does that sound like you're
staying out of our way?

472
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:40,900
50/50, mate.

473
00:31:45,855 --> 00:31:50,003
I like you, Reggie.
50/50 it is. Done.

474
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:54,205
I'm glad that we could make a
deal.- Yeah.- Now this feels right.

475
00:31:54,224 --> 00:31:57,080
Listen, uh, you come to
Philadelphia anytime...

476
00:31:57,026 --> 00:32:01,031
you see what you want, any size, any
shape, right? We'll get it for ya.

477
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:04,316
A nice Italian girl. A little
spaghetti and meatballs.

478
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,407
I prefer boys.

479
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:10,092
Excuse me? I didn't catch that.

480
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:15,621
I said I prefer boys.
Italians, actually.

481
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,005
Sometimes Greek, but I'm
not prejudiced. No.

482
00:32:18,886 --> 00:32:21,888
Because I happened to
have a Negro, once.

483
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:26,887
And a Tahitian who I bent up like a
pretzel. I really fucking hurt him.

484
00:32:32,544 --> 00:32:35,502
You've got a lot of fucking
balls to admit that, kid. You

485
00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:38,466
know what, you've got some set
of fucking gestantes on you.

486
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:41,180
You know what I say to that?
Bravo a salute.

487
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:43,494
C'mon. Salute. Huh?
Am I right, fellas?

488
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:45,688
What fucking balls. Salute.
Cheers, mate. Cheers.

489
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,287
Well done.
Cheers, mate.

490
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:59,769
<i>You don't understand.
He's not what you think he is, alright?</i>

491
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,240
<i>He is really sweet
and it is exciting to be with him.</i>

492
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:05,887
<i>Just because you have a boring life
doesn't mean I have to as well.</i>

493
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:09,864
<i>If I have a boring life, it's
because I gave up my life for you.</i>

494
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:23,220
Oh, Frankie, you take my breath away.

495
00:33:24,158 --> 00:33:25,828
You can have mine.

496
00:33:36,332 --> 00:33:38,960
You're a joker. Go on, get in the car.

497
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:44,793
Hurry up.

498
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:50,548
<i>Esmeralda's Barn made
money like a dream. Two</i>

499
00:33:50,431 --> 00:33:52,864
<i>thousand pounds a week pure profit.</i>

500
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,243
<i>There was nothing to do but enjoy it.</i>

501
00:33:55,893 --> 00:33:58,234
<i>Owning that casino meant
everything to Reggie.</i>

502
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:01,138
<i>He'd finally crossed the
line between the old East</i>

503
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,582
<i>End and the green pastures
of the Golden West.</i>

504
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,228
<i>He was becoming a celebrity himself.</i>

505
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:08,798
<i>As long as their health
didn't suffer, the high</i>

506
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:11,130
<i>rollers loved rubbing elbows
with gangsters.</i>

507
00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:15,370
<i>Aristocrats and criminals
have a lot in common.</i>

508
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:18,650
<i>They're both selfish, get
bored easily...</i>

509
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:22,362
<i>and have access to wads of cash they
didn't have to work honestly to get.</i>

510
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:27,907
<i>The topper? Neither have any interest
in bourgeois rules or morality.</i>

511
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:31,177
<i>Put it all together
with a roulette wheel .</i>

512
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,078
<i>A stunning recipe for success.</i>

513
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:37,156
<i>Ron was the odd man out.</i>

514
00:34:37,232 --> 00:34:40,530
<i>His pills stabilized him,
but they'd never cure him.</i>

515
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:42,369
<i>Clubland held little charm...</i>

516
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,082
<i>and he yearned for Reggie
and the dark side of gangland.</i>

517
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:50,003
As soon as you turn your back...

518
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:54,559
life plays dirty tricks on ya, y'know?

519
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:15,064
<i>We wouldn't spend Christmas
together that year.</i>

520
00:35:15,796 --> 00:35:18,092
<i>There was an old warrant on Reggie.</i>

521
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:22,299
<i>The last six months of his sentence was
on appeal, but it was denied.</i>

522
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:24,691
<i>He was to surrender in the morning.</i>

523
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:28,987
<i>My real life was about to begin.</i>

524
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,999
See you in a bit.

525
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:22,462
See ya later, Reg.
So long, Reg.

526
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:29,630
Frank.

527
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:35,350
Will you look after your sister while
I'm away? I will, Reg. Yeah?- Yeah.

528
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:37,209
Good lad.

529
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,805
Move it, Kray.

530
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:06,169
Stop on the line.

531
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:09,583
You're nothing in here.

532
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:12,770
Fuck him.

533
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:14,686
Fuck him up.

534
00:37:17,681 --> 00:37:21,227
<i>Leave him alone, Gibbsy.
Bury him, Reggie </i>.

535
00:37:21,445 --> 00:37:23,364
Shut up, all of ya.

536
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:27,475
<i>Come on, Reg.
Don't let them do you like this </i>.

537
00:37:27,531 --> 00:37:29,645
You're not so tough now, are ya, eh?

538
00:37:31,175 --> 00:37:33,980
<i>Give that bastard some back.</i>

539
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:38,324
You're nothing in here.

540
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,044
Nothing. - please, no more, governor.
No more, please.

541
00:37:43,162 --> 00:37:45,536
That's more like it, Reggie.
Please?

542
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,256
A little respect doesn't hurt, does it?

543
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,420
No more.

544
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,003
I have shit bigger turds.

545
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:58,543
Please, water.
You want some water?

546
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:01,748
Look at that, gents. He's only
begging for water. Fuck off, PT

547
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:05,650
What do you think of him now, your
famous Reggie fucking Kray? Fuck you!

548
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:10,406
Begging for fucking water.
What has he come to.

549
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:15,553
Here you are, Reg. Now don't spill it.
Cos you've had a little tumble, ain't ya?

550
00:38:16,464 --> 00:38:17,799
Hey?

551
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:21,745
Good boy.

552
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:24,705
Water?- Look.- Fucking cockhead.
Fuck off.- Look who

553
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,380
it is. Reggie Kray, begging
for fucking... water.

554
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:45,507
Reggie... Reggie... Reggie

555
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:55,408
Hello, Frances.

556
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:58,629
Hello, Ron.
I've saw Reg today.

557
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:00,785
He sends his best. He
says it's probably best

558
00:39:00,707 --> 00:39:02,965
that you don't go visit
him this year, alright?

559
00:39:03,192 --> 00:39:06,237
Did he say why?
No, he didn't mention it.

560
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:11,554
Did you know that it is
possible, right, for a

561
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:14,530
person to become a ghost
while they're still alive?

562
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:16,827
Do you think so?

563
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,372
Well it's happened to you, innit?

564
00:39:26,137 --> 00:39:28,566
No no no, listen.
No, what?

565
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,293
No no no, please please please.
Just for a moment. Just listen.

566
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:35,561
Gambling clubs are legally obliged
to pay winnings on the spot.

567
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:37,491
And that is why we insist
our gamblers pay their

568
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,263
debts on the spot as well.
It's very simple.

569
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:42,184
Yes, I know. I've heard
you, but that's your

570
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:45,412
problem, right? That's
your problem and not mine.

571
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:48,508
Mine is that I want fifty thousand pounds.

572
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:51,713
Oh, here you go again with your fifty
thousand pounds to go to Nigeria.

573
00:39:51,604 --> 00:39:56,861
It is not just to go to Nigeria, is it?
I want to set up a company.

574
00:39:56,713 --> 00:40:01,237
Right? I want to build a city
in Nigeria for the children.

575
00:40:01,252 --> 00:40:04,975
Near Enugu.
Enugu. Yes, Enugu.

576
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:09,417
Yes, Enugu. I told you, Enugu, right?
You don't know everything, do you, Payne?

577
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:12,710
Did you know that "Enugu"
is the African word for 'Utopia'?

578
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:13,894
No.
No you did not.

579
00:40:13,863 --> 00:40:17,116
Did you know that 'Utopia' is
the Greek word for 'nowhere'?

580
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,195
For fifty thousand pounds I
can make that 'somewhere'.

581
00:40:20,138 --> 00:40:24,453
I can turn it into a place where people
will smile at me and children will dance.

582
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,544
I will smile for you, Ron.

583
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,895
I will smile for you if you tell me
where I can get fifty thousand pounds.

584
00:40:30,738 --> 00:40:34,095
I'm telling you, I'm fucking telling
you... just put it out of the casino.

585
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:36,043
I cannot put it out of the
casino that's what I'm

586
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:37,854
saying.
Put it out of the casino, you cunt.

587
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:40,300
Despite the temptation. Do
not meddle with a foolproof

588
00:40:40,212 --> 00:40:42,636
way of making the money.
I am not a fucking banker.

589
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:45,847
No no no!- I am not a fucking banker.
Great! Genius.

590
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:48,838
Look at that. That has made
it all the more mendable.

591
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:51,718
This is a man who wants to build a city.
Don't you fucking threaten me, you cunt.

592
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:54,758
Don't you fucking dare
talk to me like that, you cunt.

593
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:59,711
Reggie is not here now, alright?
He's fucking gone, isn't he?

594
00:40:59,616 --> 00:41:02,541
So you work for me, Ron Kray.

595
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,658
So you will trotter on
down to the fucking bank

596
00:41:05,544 --> 00:41:08,634
and you will fetch me my
fifty thousand pounds.

597
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:11,178
Yeah, I'll go to the bank and have a
little talk to them and see what I can do.

598
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:14,058
And I'll tell you. I
may work for you, Ron,

599
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:16,891
but I'm certainly not
afraid of you, alright?

600
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:20,976
Well that is fucking stupid as well,
because you fucking should be.

601
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,967
Because if my brother hadn't of vouched
for you, you'd be fucking dead.

602
00:41:52,129 --> 00:41:53,395
What happened?

603
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,490
What are you doing here? Didn't
Ronnie tell you not to come?

604
00:41:59,856 --> 00:42:01,110
I missed you.
Yeah.

605
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:05,820
Frankie, I don't want you to come here
and see me like this. Do you understand?

606
00:42:06,063 --> 00:42:08,151
Who did it?
What?

607
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:11,145
Your face.
Was it one of the other prisoners?

608
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:14,850
No. No, it was one of the guards, alright?

609
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:16,914
Have you reported them?
No.

610
00:42:16,996 --> 00:42:20,248
But y'know what? When I get out, I'm thinking,
right, I might roll down to the ol' houses

611
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:23,246
of parliment and have a word with the prime
minister. Because he will listen. He will.

612
00:42:23,185 --> 00:42:27,039
Frankie, this is prison.
OK? That's what it is, is.

613
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,046
The law of the jungle in here.

614
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:31,536
But don't worry about it because
I'm a big boy and I can

615
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,785
look after meself. And I'll
be out very soon, alright?

616
00:42:33,979 --> 00:42:37,977
Go on and look at that lump over there.
You see him? With the big hat.

617
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:43,739
There's a very good reason why we
all call him handbag. Alright?

618
00:42:47,226 --> 00:42:48,852
I don't want a life like this.

619
00:42:50,632 --> 00:42:54,594
Just waiting for you while you're
in prison. I know. I know, right.

620
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:00,712
Frankie, it won't happen again.

621
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:02,759
How can you be sure?
Because I know.

622
00:43:02,702 --> 00:43:06,648
Because I promise you that it won't happen again. Alright?

623
00:43:07,776 --> 00:43:10,756
I know how you can know be sure.
Go on.

624
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,326
You could go straight.

625
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:17,109
Be a casino owner. Club owner.
You enjoy it.

626
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:18,883
Just forget everything else.

627
00:43:18,962 --> 00:43:23,554
It really is that simple for you, innit?
Just "go straight?"

628
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:29,350
Babe, Life isn't always the
way we want it to be, y'know?

629
00:43:29,264 --> 00:43:32,717
Life has other plans. It's
the way it is, it's life.

630
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,860
I love you.

631
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,943
I love you.

632
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:44,437
I've never loved anybody before,
but I love you, Reggie.

633
00:43:47,938 --> 00:43:49,188
And I love you too.

634
00:43:55,104 --> 00:43:58,894
Do you think it can protect people?
What?

635
00:43:59,228 --> 00:44:00,438
Love.

636
00:44:03,115 --> 00:44:06,660
I like him. Yeah, he's got
something about him, doesn't he?

637
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:07,996
You know what I reckon it is?

638
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:09,829
- What? I think it's his hips.
- Yeah.

639
00:44:10,184 --> 00:44:13,209
I want to blow the soul out of that horn.

640
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:16,309
You feeling a bit horny, are you, Ron?

641
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,920
I am. I am.

642
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:24,374
Go on, do it. I will. Do it. I want
to blow the soul out of that horn.

643
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:26,623
I am going to do it.
Bugger you, Tiger.

644
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:41,610
That's it, Ron. Give it a fucking blow.

645
00:44:51,403 --> 00:44:52,882
Kill it.

646
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:02,810
Oh, fucking hell. Right.

647
00:45:05,218 --> 00:45:08,363
Hello? Hello?
Yes, Ron, Hello.

648
00:45:08,302 --> 00:45:11,431
You know when I plan
to die?

649
00:45:11,664 --> 00:45:12,982
When, Ron?

650
00:45:13,348 --> 00:45:15,067
In the very last minute.

651
00:45:16,712 --> 00:45:19,757
Don't fucking encourage
him, for fuck's sake.

652
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:24,092
Look at you, you flash fuckers, alright?

653
00:45:25,776 --> 00:45:31,886
Now I may not be very good,
right, but a good gangster?

654
00:45:32,088 --> 00:45:37,889
Oh yeah. I'll fucking claim that title.
And how many titles could you claim? Hey?

655
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:42,929
Superficial light.
Oh yeah?

656
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,629
Dripping in your synthetic opulates.

657
00:45:47,985 --> 00:45:52,952
Ha. It's disgusting, really it is.
Yeah.

658
00:45:53,069 --> 00:45:56,736
Right. A bit of magic. You love magic,
don't you? All kids love magic.

659
00:45:58,035 --> 00:46:03,576
You might all be aware that there are
three magic 'C's in the word Carpacia.

660
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:07,267
But how many C's...

661
00:46:08,491 --> 00:46:11,280
are there in the word cunt?

662
00:46:13,968 --> 00:46:16,100
Just you.

663
00:46:40,158 --> 00:46:41,459
You're free.

664
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:45,019
What are you doing throwing
stones at the window?

665
00:46:44,923 --> 00:46:47,517
They're not stones. These
are Lemon Sherberts.

666
00:46:47,573 --> 00:46:48,799
Here you go.

667
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:51,410
Oh, well played!

668
00:46:51,941 --> 00:46:56,394
Why don't you ring the bell?
Well, your mum. I mean.

669
00:46:56,582 --> 00:46:58,574
I'm not being funny here,
but the thought of your

670
00:46:58,505 --> 00:47:00,349
mum answering that door
is a bit shocking, so.

671
00:47:00,724 --> 00:47:02,727
I thought she'd give me grief
on account of where I've been.

672
00:47:02,711 --> 00:47:06,781
You mean prison?
Yeah, prison. You look beautiful.

673
00:47:07,155 --> 00:47:08,489
You look beautiful too.

674
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:13,460
I know it's a bit late, alright,
but I've got your Christmas present here.

675
00:47:13,536 --> 00:47:15,499
Do you want me to throw it up?
No.

676
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:19,141
Well, do you want me to deliver it?
I ain't going through that door.

677
00:47:19,597 --> 00:47:20,883
Alright.

678
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:24,893
You cheeky bugger.

679
00:47:29,258 --> 00:47:30,500
Be careful.

680
00:47:32,156 --> 00:47:34,284
Bit late now, innit?

681
00:47:35,475 --> 00:47:38,895
Right. Your flowers.
Thank you.

682
00:47:39,787 --> 00:47:41,001
And...

683
00:47:42,655 --> 00:47:44,434
your Christmas present.

684
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:46,475
Sorry it's late.

685
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:50,741
Go on. Open it.

686
00:47:54,524 --> 00:47:56,692
Frances Shea, will you marry me?

687
00:48:00,905 --> 00:48:02,584
We live free and above board?

688
00:48:04,469 --> 00:48:05,856
On my honor.

689
00:48:08,924 --> 00:48:11,553
Yes, Reggie Kray, I will marry you.

690
00:48:18,726 --> 00:48:20,029
That weren't mine!

691
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:22,999
Cheeky.

692
00:48:27,234 --> 00:48:28,711
Bastard!

693
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:33,406
C'mon, show us your fucking hoochie!
Give us a fucking

694
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:35,946
look.- You're not listening.
You're not listening.

695
00:48:35,905 --> 00:48:40,389
All I'm saying... All I'm saying
is crime is still a business.

696
00:48:40,227 --> 00:48:44,191
You need a public relations department
and we've got Joseph Goebbels.

697
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,285
Is he the fat one?

698
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:48,626
You read lips.
What's he saying? What's he saying, Les?

699
00:48:48,658 --> 00:48:53,663
Oh, stroke him off. I think he's saying
something about Gobbles... or nobles

700
00:48:54,942 --> 00:48:56,319
That's very strange.

701
00:48:57,624 --> 00:48:59,710
He ain't happy.
You'll see.

702
00:49:05,183 --> 00:49:06,685
Nice, innit?

703
00:49:08,475 --> 00:49:13,272
Oh, he looks lovely, Ron. Yeah, he's put
on a little bit of "timboo", innit he?

704
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:16,121
He's going to be very, very upset.

705
00:49:16,611 --> 00:49:18,141
Did I miss something?

706
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:23,674
Is this not... this is Friday night, right?
Well, I tried to tell you.

707
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:25,271
Yeah, but it's Friday
night, right? You

708
00:49:25,217 --> 00:49:27,070
didn't tell me that it
was this bad, did you?

709
00:49:27,152 --> 00:49:29,890
It's Ron, innit? He's run the
place into the ground. He's

710
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:32,398
turned a straight money
earner into a financial wreck

711
00:49:32,312 --> 00:49:34,582
And I'll tell you one other thing...
this place

712
00:49:34,501 --> 00:49:36,643
will crash when we get
our tax bill next week.

713
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,762
What's he saying?
Go on, what's he saying?

714
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:43,739
He's just told him that you're missing
tax payments. The silly cunt.

715
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,818
Let's go.

716
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,718
Right, listen. It's still an
honest business, you understand?

717
00:49:52,371 --> 00:49:54,028
How very rude.

718
00:49:55,364 --> 00:50:00,701
Hey! Where are you going?
This is fucking criminal mate

719
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:04,563
Hey! Where are you going?

720
00:50:08,009 --> 00:50:11,345
Oh, there he is. My
beautiful brother, Reggie.

721
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:13,748
A toast to my beautiful brother.

722
00:50:13,675 --> 00:50:18,151
Home at last, like Agamemnon returned
to Ithaca.

723
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:24,300
And beautiful Frances, where have you been?
It's as if you've returned from the dead.

724
00:50:24,335 --> 00:50:27,169
What are you doing, mate?
What are you fucking playing at? Hey?

725
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:29,285
I'm not playing at anything, am I?
It's you. You

726
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:31,027
come in here, You don't
even say "Hello, Ron."

727
00:50:31,015 --> 00:50:33,249
You don't even have a drink.
You just bugger off. What's

728
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,180
that about?
All right. Hello, Ron. Cheers, mate.

729
00:50:35,256 --> 00:50:37,242
Fuck you!
What are you shouting at me, for?

730
00:50:37,184 --> 00:50:39,406
Because you, right? You had the
world on a string, yeah...

731
00:50:39,377 --> 00:50:42,207
but you couldn't hold it
together, so you fucked it up.

732
00:50:42,258 --> 00:50:43,527
Don't... uh, listen, you was away.

733
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:46,124
I was in prison. I was in prison!
So I had to make do with what I had.

734
00:50:46,342 --> 00:50:48,344
Are you going Ron or Reg?

735
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,005
Score?
Mmm hmm.

736
00:50:51,743 --> 00:50:54,762
Reginald. He'll never go
down in front of the missus.

737
00:50:54,705 --> 00:50:57,047
You had everything, mate. You had it all.
You are... I didn't have you, right.

738
00:50:57,017 --> 00:51:00,545
Unbelievable.- Reggie.- It's all
right, honestly. I've got this. It's fine.

739
00:51:00,467 --> 00:51:02,572
Yeah, actually, he's got this.
Thank you very much. He's

740
00:51:02,498 --> 00:51:04,577
a big boy. We're talking about
earning a living. Y'know?

741
00:51:04,554 --> 00:51:06,798
We're talking about being
gangsters, right, which

742
00:51:06,718 --> 00:51:08,794
is what we are. So you
can just fuck off...

743
00:51:08,772 --> 00:51:10,017
Go on.
Don't.

744
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:14,450
Y'know, one of these days, Ron Kray, your
miserable life will swallow you whole.

745
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,925
Yeah, well you should know all
about it, actually, y'know,

746
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:18,848
because I have heard all the stories.
They're not good...

747
00:51:18,793 --> 00:51:20,853
Your mum did palm us off
with the damaged goods,

748
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:23,106
didn't she? And you're very,
very damaged, aren't you?

749
00:51:23,073 --> 00:51:26,097
Alright, just get in the car. Don't you
ever speak to Frances like that again.

750
00:51:26,004 --> 00:51:28,331
That's right, Frances. Blood
is thicker than water,

751
00:51:28,248 --> 00:51:30,453
y'know? And I've been with
Reggie since the womb.

752
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:33,708
Ron, shut up. I want you to apologize to
Frances right now.

753
00:51:33,718 --> 00:51:37,846
Right... right. All right, Frances.

754
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,197
I'm sorry, alright?

755
00:51:40,278 --> 00:51:45,619
Yes. I'm truly very sorry. The club is
very, very empty. A bit like you, really.

756
00:51:45,465 --> 00:51:48,288
There is fuck all in it,
apart my brother's cock.

757
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:09,646
You, alright, are a fucking disgrace, mate.

758
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:14,091
You hit me.

759
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:15,510
Yeah.

760
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:19,724
No...

761
00:52:20,657 --> 00:52:21,342
No...

762
00:52:21,415 --> 00:52:22,710
No...

763
00:52:22,753 --> 00:52:23,753
No, Ron.

764
00:52:24,672 --> 00:52:27,672
No... no.

765
00:52:29,003 --> 00:52:30,961
Now you've done it, you fucking cunt.

766
00:52:34,058 --> 00:52:35,643
Fucking cunt.

767
00:52:38,774 --> 00:52:40,785
For fuck's sake. Not the bottle.
Not the bottle, you...

768
00:52:45,382 --> 00:52:47,805
No! Not the balls.

769
00:52:50,286 --> 00:52:51,540
Fucking cunt! Wanker!

770
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:57,031
Sweetheart, please leave.

771
00:52:57,748 --> 00:52:59,701
Fucking... Fucking cunt!

772
00:53:09,961 --> 00:53:11,289
Give me that.

773
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:18,822
Never mess with a man's jewels, mate.

774
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:23,085
Now, what are you doing?
No, Ron. No, no. No,

775
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:24,537
no. That is a bottle, Ron.
That bottle...

776
00:53:35,362 --> 00:53:38,822
I'm gonna split 'em up. Just a minute,
you fucking sit down, you shit.

777
00:53:39,292 --> 00:53:42,788
They're family. Save it. Get
out of the fucking way.

778
00:53:44,485 --> 00:53:48,686
Put it down.
It's gone too far.

779
00:53:49,087 --> 00:53:53,091
Now, I told you.
Now, c'mon, that's enough.

780
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,063
No.

781
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:00,949
No.

782
00:54:02,532 --> 00:54:04,366
Enough, Reg, mate.

783
00:54:04,772 --> 00:54:07,982
You just don't understand.
Fuh... Fuck.

784
00:54:09,132 --> 00:54:11,990
You don't understand me.
Well, that's probably because

785
00:54:11,886 --> 00:54:14,605
I don't want to fucking
understand you right now Ron.

786
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:20,814
I just wanted to just, y'know...
There's no point in fucking explaining.

787
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:27,237
It's fucking hopeless. Go on. Help me up.
Help me up. That really fucking hurt.

788
00:54:27,938 --> 00:54:30,317
What are you doing? For fuck's sake, Ron.

789
00:54:30,286 --> 00:54:36,099
What I'm trying to tell you is
very simple, right? Listen.

790
00:54:36,382 --> 00:54:39,261
I am very, very...

791
00:54:40,024 --> 00:54:43,571
very fragile myself, alright?

792
00:54:43,585 --> 00:54:45,102
Yup, fragile, I've got it.

793
00:54:45,587 --> 00:54:47,913
Very fragile.
I've got it!

794
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:58,291
Alright, c'mon now, for fuck's sake.

795
00:54:58,375 --> 00:55:01,137
I'm not myself.

796
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,070
This isn't me, is it?

797
00:55:03,152 --> 00:55:06,115
This isn't us. None of this is us.

798
00:55:08,155 --> 00:55:10,409
I am very sorry.
It's OK.

799
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:12,125
Are you done?

800
00:55:12,994 --> 00:55:14,496
Is she gone?

801
00:55:14,596 --> 00:55:15,889
Yes, she's gone.

802
00:55:15,999 --> 00:55:17,248
She's a keeper.

803
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:19,608
Gee, thanks, Ron.
Thanks.

804
00:55:30,842 --> 00:55:33,472
There she is.
Yup, I've got her.

805
00:55:33,522 --> 00:55:35,192
Alright, stop here.

806
00:55:36,404 --> 00:55:38,530
That girl's gonna be the death of me.

807
00:55:38,604 --> 00:55:39,982
Go on, there ya go.

808
00:55:40,487 --> 00:55:43,446
Frankie. Frank.
Excuse me, sorry.

809
00:55:43,487 --> 00:55:47,332
I need to have a word with you about
something. I don't care if you forget me.

810
00:55:47,195 --> 00:55:48,836
Don't say that.
It's true.

811
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:51,917
You don't mean it. Don't tell me
what I mean. I know what I mean.

812
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,141
Come on... Come on, Frances.
Can't we just start again?

813
00:55:54,212 --> 00:55:56,046
Right? From the beginning,
y'know, right? We can

814
00:55:55,983 --> 00:55:57,641
get rid of everything
that's bad, right...

815
00:55:57,731 --> 00:55:59,316
and we'll just keep everything that's good.

816
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:03,187
What about Ron?
What about Ron?

817
00:56:03,574 --> 00:56:05,841
Well he's not exactly a good bit, is he?
Well,

818
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,945
eh, I mean he's not exactly
a bad bit, either.

819
00:56:08,014 --> 00:56:09,754
Y'know?- He was awful to me yesterday.
Yeah,

820
00:56:09,695 --> 00:56:11,447
yeah he was, but y'know that's...
that's Ron.

821
00:56:11,537 --> 00:56:16,294
If he don't take his tablets, he is,
he is, he's like, he is a nightmare.

822
00:56:16,738 --> 00:56:18,840
He is not always like that, y'know?
He's got a heart of gold.

823
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,570
He loves you bits, he
thinks the world of you.

824
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,370
Honestly, when you left, he was in pieces.

825
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,672
He was like: "Where did she go?"
I said, "She's left."

826
00:56:24,743 --> 00:56:27,202
"Well you better get
after here, cos she's a keeper."

827
00:56:27,624 --> 00:56:31,128
You are a keeper. So he's right. He said
Tell her I'm very sorry.

828
00:56:31,186 --> 00:56:32,643
He is sorry, and I'm sorry.

829
00:56:32,746 --> 00:56:34,495
We're all sorry.
But you know what?

830
00:56:34,747 --> 00:56:37,497
That's what happens sometimes.
Families are stupid, aren't they?

831
00:56:37,546 --> 00:56:39,632
They fight... they make up...

832
00:56:39,706 --> 00:56:43,377
they... they... they stick together
because they love each other.

833
00:56:43,428 --> 00:56:44,930
That's what they do.

834
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:48,196
Don't tell me about
forgetting you, alright,

835
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:49,318
because that ain't
happening either.

836
00:56:49,432 --> 00:56:51,559
Y'know, I spent the last six months
thinking about nothing but you.

837
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:53,883
So I get out and the club's got me a...
Alright.

838
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:56,128
I'm sorry.

839
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:57,778
Alright.

840
00:56:57,795 --> 00:57:02,383
<i>It was time for the Krays to enter the
secret history of the 1960's.</i>

841
00:57:06,231 --> 00:57:07,692
<i>As absurd as it seems...</i>

842
00:57:07,795 --> 00:57:12,423
<i>it grew out of Ron's nutter dream of
building a utopian city in Nigeria.</i>

843
00:57:13,713 --> 00:57:15,883
Some are born to be Ronnie Kray...

844
00:57:16,514 --> 00:57:20,146
and some have Ronnie Kray thrust upon them.

845
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:25,172
<i>Lord Boothby was a distinguished
member of the House of Lords.</i>

846
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:27,493
Ronnie.
Yes?

847
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:30,480
I regret that my answer is no.

848
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,091
Nigeria is simply too far away...

849
00:57:34,123 --> 00:57:38,543
and I never involve myself in a
thing I can't control personally.

850
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:41,064
I'm so sorry.

851
00:57:44,244 --> 00:57:46,370
He's really lovely, isn't he?

852
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:50,332
I take it you like ice
and a slice, my lord?

853
00:57:50,406 --> 00:57:52,576
Ice and a slice.

854
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:54,180
Please, Teddy bear.

855
00:57:54,288 --> 00:57:56,623
And don't spare the horses.

856
00:57:58,649 --> 00:58:02,528
Do you know where I hear that lemons
are particularly lovely and fresh?

857
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:04,633
No, where?

858
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,860
Enugu... Nigeria.

859
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:09,100
You're very well informed, Teddy.

860
00:58:09,574 --> 00:58:11,575
Very well informed.

861
00:58:12,174 --> 00:58:13,636
Down the hatch.

862
00:58:14,656 --> 00:58:17,114
Do you like it down the hatch, Teddy?

863
00:58:18,016 --> 00:58:20,851
Boothby declined,
but friendship ensued.

864
00:58:20,936 --> 00:58:24,191
And the perverted Peer was soon a guest
at Ron's flat.

865
00:58:24,216 --> 00:58:27,139
The ripples would spread far and wide.

866
00:58:27,377 --> 00:58:29,463
Do call me later, Tom.

867
00:58:29,902 --> 00:58:31,735
Harry, all alone?

868
00:58:31,822 --> 00:58:34,404
No need to be. There is
plenty of fruit on the tree.

869
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:38,005
Tom, not in the House of Commons tonight?

870
00:58:38,502 --> 00:58:39,920
Yeah.

871
00:58:40,023 --> 00:58:42,273
Fucking look at me, you cunt.

872
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:44,047
Yeah?

873
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:47,487
Go on. Fucking look at him now.

874
00:58:48,148 --> 00:58:49,813
Fucking look at me.

875
00:58:51,547 --> 00:58:53,757
Look at me.

876
00:58:57,228 --> 00:58:59,606
Good lord, that's Bob Boothby.

877
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,168
Yes, Prime Minister, sir.

878
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:02,686
At an orgy!

879
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:06,144
The tories are going to have
trouble explaining this.

880
00:59:08,994 --> 00:59:10,243
Here, sir.

881
00:59:13,035 --> 00:59:14,453
Is that Tom Driberg?

882
00:59:14,556 --> 00:59:15,805
In fact, yes, sir.

883
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:19,668
There is no moral advantage to my party
if my party are also involved.

884
00:59:19,676 --> 00:59:21,426
It gets a bit stickier, sir.

885
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:23,058
Where were these photos taken?

886
00:59:23,156 --> 00:59:24,409
Cazenove Road, Hackney.

887
00:59:24,716 --> 00:59:26,254
What in god's boots
were they doing in

888
00:59:26,203 --> 00:59:27,992
Hackney?
Well that's where it gets sticky.

889
00:59:28,077 --> 00:59:30,708
I thought the orgy was the sticky bit...
it gets stickier still?

890
00:59:30,759 --> 00:59:33,762
We've had two brothers,
gangsters, under surveillance.

891
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:35,262
The Krays.

892
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,115
The photographs were taken
in Ronald Kray's flat.

893
00:59:38,564 --> 00:59:42,523
Orgies aside, we're tracking
fraud, protection rackets...

894
00:59:42,524 --> 00:59:45,319
And the American mafia
might also be involved.

895
00:59:46,285 --> 00:59:48,788
London's bottom had reached her top.

896
00:59:48,847 --> 00:59:50,140
Scandal loomed.

897
00:59:50,245 --> 00:59:52,331
The elections are in ten weeks.

898
00:59:52,408 --> 00:59:54,730
They'll vote out both sides of the house.

899
00:59:54,655 --> 00:59:56,902
What exactly are you doing about it?

900
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,513
Bugger all, by the looks of it.

901
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,033
Is that Italian?

902
01:00:03,328 --> 01:00:04,457
I don't know.

903
01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:06,071
Is it a Daimler?

904
01:00:07,811 --> 01:00:09,437
It's nice, that is.

905
01:00:09,532 --> 01:00:11,286
Oh, what do you want for Christmas?

906
01:00:12,774 --> 01:00:14,502
Umm, I don't know. You
don't have to get me

907
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:16,499
anything.- Ey?- You don't
have to get me a present.

908
01:00:16,573 --> 01:00:19,536
Oh, that is ridiculous.
Not get you anything for Christmas?

909
01:00:19,577 --> 01:00:21,951
Alright, well you surprise me then.
I'll give you a sack of coal.

910
01:00:22,016 --> 01:00:24,395
I'll get you a sockful of coal.
Lucky thing.

911
01:00:24,456 --> 01:00:25,957
Well, what about that?

912
01:00:26,338 --> 01:00:27,671
What about it?

913
01:00:27,778 --> 01:00:28,879
For Christmas.

914
01:00:29,779 --> 01:00:31,236
For me?

915
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,087
That's going to be my club.

916
01:00:33,178 --> 01:00:35,016
Is it?
Yeah.

917
01:00:35,741 --> 01:00:38,452
West End, a touch of class.

918
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:41,669
That is our ticket out of here.

919
01:00:44,703 --> 01:00:46,120
It's snowing.

920
01:00:47,325 --> 01:00:48,326
Yeah.

921
01:00:49,385 --> 01:00:50,571
Gone.

922
01:00:52,385 --> 01:00:54,888
<i>What did I want for Christmas?</i>

923
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:57,449
<i>My Reggie, free and above board.</i>

924
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,876
<i>But Ron wanted his Reggie back as well.</i>

925
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:02,411
<i>He longed for his gangster twin.</i>

926
01:01:02,468 --> 01:01:05,515
<i>And Reggie... he chose the
HIDE-A-WAY instead.</i>

927
01:01:10,032 --> 01:01:13,703
<i>The owner was Hugh McCowan, the
son of a baronet.</i>

928
01:01:13,874 --> 01:01:17,085
<i>Though he was not usually intimidated
by the working classes...</i>

929
01:01:17,115 --> 01:01:19,241
<i>he agreed to sell half the club.</i>

930
01:01:19,316 --> 01:01:21,633
<i>Reggie knew he'd get the rest in time.</i>

931
01:01:21,558 --> 01:01:23,849
<i>A dirty deal for a clean life.</i>

932
01:01:24,237 --> 01:01:27,116
<i>Ron was terrified of
Reggie leaving him behind.</i>

933
01:01:27,157 --> 01:01:29,458
<i>He sent Mad Teddy round to kill the deal.</i>
Listen, gentlemen...

934
01:01:29,383 --> 01:01:30,733
I've spoken to Reggie
I'm sorry...

935
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,343
I can't look at you, darling, or I'm
going to get lost in your eyes.

936
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,620
I've got a deal with Reggie...
This is shit.

937
01:01:35,592 --> 01:01:37,686
I signed a contract.

938
01:01:37,842 --> 01:01:39,968
I have an arrangement with Reggie, ask him.

939
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,906
Crap.
Gentlemen, please.

940
01:01:42,002 --> 01:01:43,628
Please, I have customers.

941
01:01:43,724 --> 01:01:45,518
Out of the way. That's it, come on.

942
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:47,272
I have customers here, gentlemen, please.

943
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:48,467
I have spoken to Reggie.

944
01:01:48,687 --> 01:01:51,978
We don't work for Reggie.
We work for Ronnie.

945
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:53,883
<i>Ron almost got what he wanted.</i>

946
01:01:53,968 --> 01:01:56,927
<i>McCowan backed out of the deal,
but he also called the police.</i>

947
01:01:56,968 --> 01:01:59,635
<i>Reggie and Ron were both charged
with extortion.</i>

948
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:02,312
Frannie, I'm tell you, the
police stitched me up.

949
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:03,495
I am innocent.
I'm...

950
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:05,359
completely innocent.
Even if you are...

951
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,619
What?

952
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:08,606
You're back in prison.

953
01:02:09,453 --> 01:02:10,554
You made a promise to me.

954
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:12,785
And it still stands.
I'm fucking innocent!

955
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:19,149
Sorry, I don't mean to
swear at you, alright?

956
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:23,159
I really want you to marry me.

957
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:26,228
Please.

958
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,543
If you're innocent and acquitted,
I'll marry you.

959
01:02:34,821 --> 01:02:38,072
If you're guilty, I never want to
see you again. Why do you say that?

960
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:39,226
Frankie, don't...

961
01:02:39,341 --> 01:02:41,095
Frankie, don't.

962
01:02:41,381 --> 01:02:44,428
<i>Strangely, it was Lord Boothby
who saved the day.</i>

963
01:02:44,542 --> 01:02:47,753
<i>His walk on the wild side
had not gone unnoticed.</i>

964
01:02:49,187 --> 01:02:51,397
I've finally found the photo.

965
01:02:52,425 --> 01:02:55,264
It's been forwarded to the proper places.

966
01:02:55,866 --> 01:02:57,536
Say: "Enugu".

967
01:02:57,626 --> 01:02:59,464
Enugu.

968
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:03,717
The photograph taken in Boothby's
flat ended up with the paper.

969
01:03:03,749 --> 01:03:05,875
Along with the story of
sexual misconduct...

970
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,660
between a gangster and the
member of the House of Lords.

971
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:12,812
The problem is Arnold,
that, unfortunately...

972
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,208
It's all true for once.

973
01:03:15,273 --> 01:03:17,775
I don't care about the truth, Harold.

974
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:20,630
Except that, the greater the truth...

975
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:22,343
the greater the libel.

976
01:03:22,675 --> 01:03:23,968
An election was looming.

977
01:03:24,076 --> 01:03:27,620
But the Prime Minister brought in his
fixer, Arnold Goodman to sort things out.

978
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:30,601
Get me Cecil King at the Sunday Mirror.

979
01:03:30,638 --> 01:03:34,602
The great and the good engineered
a cover-up. A cracking good one.

980
01:03:35,078 --> 01:03:38,710
When the Kray's defense threatened to call
Boothby as a character witness...

981
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,221
the implication was clear.

982
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,303
The government would have
to drop its case...

983
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,994
or face the consequences.

984
01:03:44,082 --> 01:03:47,669
It was this that made the Krays
the untouchables of London crime.

985
01:03:47,686 --> 01:03:52,899
New information casts poor light on
the prosecution witness, Mr. McCowan.

986
01:03:54,888 --> 01:03:56,181
Case dismissed.

987
01:03:56,889 --> 01:04:01,309
That night the Kray's held their
celebration party at McCowan's club.

988
01:04:01,287 --> 01:04:03,709
Reggie had bought the
<font face="Mistral"> HIDE-A-WAY</font> that same afternoon.

989
01:04:03,769 --> 01:04:05,646
At a discount.

990
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:07,133
Thank you.

991
01:05:58,127 --> 01:05:59,712
Why are you here, then?

992
01:06:01,768 --> 01:06:04,603
I've come to see the
difference between you and me.

993
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:07,040
The difference, yeah?

994
01:06:07,891 --> 01:06:09,184
Alright.

995
01:06:10,293 --> 01:06:12,166
What do you know?
I grew up poor...

996
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:13,669
like you.

997
01:06:13,772 --> 01:06:15,942
I boxed as a lad, like you.

998
01:06:17,575 --> 01:06:19,449
But it didn't turn me into a thief.

999
01:06:21,616 --> 01:06:24,410
But it did turn you into
policing, didn't it?

1000
01:06:25,296 --> 01:06:26,630
Yeah.

1001
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:31,988
It did turn you into handing
your own over at the bar, innit?

1002
01:06:34,419 --> 01:06:37,130
You know, the difference
between us, right...

1003
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,178
apart from, y'know, the obvious...

1004
01:06:39,259 --> 01:06:43,139
is that I, right, I work for me.

1005
01:06:43,461 --> 01:06:44,879
And you...

1006
01:06:45,462 --> 01:06:47,212
You work for them.

1007
01:07:01,546 --> 01:07:03,163
Sir, I can explain.

1008
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:05,320
This is Scotland Yard.

1009
01:07:05,991 --> 01:07:07,948
And this investigation will end at once.

1010
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:10,863
But there's so much more
that we can get them on...

1011
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:13,712
Your investigation into
the Krays will end at once!

1012
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:55,825
Alright, alright.- She's
wearing black, mate.

1013
01:07:55,927 --> 01:07:58,429
I know. I know. She's
read it wrong, isn't she?

1014
01:07:58,485 --> 01:08:00,244
She thought it was a fucking funeral.

1015
01:08:00,206 --> 01:08:03,838
Wearing black oh that fucking bitch.
I know. Don't drive yourself mad.

1016
01:08:03,848 --> 01:08:07,311
Wait'll you see the daughter,
she looks unbelievable in white.

1017
01:08:08,411 --> 01:08:10,577
What do you see in her?

1018
01:08:12,252 --> 01:08:15,587
I see meself, yeah.

1019
01:08:16,174 --> 01:08:17,755
I see what I could be.

1020
01:08:18,452 --> 01:08:19,621
Y'know?

1021
01:08:20,173 --> 01:08:23,760
If I wasn't so scared.
You're not afraid of anything.

1022
01:08:24,655 --> 01:08:26,046
Right.

1023
01:08:26,856 --> 01:08:28,982
Well, only meself, y'know.

1024
01:08:29,657 --> 01:08:32,119
And you.
Yeah.

1025
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:37,444
What is she doing?

1026
01:08:37,459 --> 01:08:39,421
You know what she's going
to be saying, alright?

1027
01:08:39,498 --> 01:08:41,752
Just take it easy. Deep breaths.

1028
01:08:43,102 --> 01:08:44,517
Why are not you inside, dear?
Are you

1029
01:08:44,471 --> 01:08:46,255
absolutely sure you want
to go through with this?

1030
01:08:46,344 --> 01:08:48,762
Mom, please, don't start this again.
It's all right, Frank.

1031
01:08:50,104 --> 01:08:51,274
I love him.

1032
01:08:51,384 --> 01:08:52,553
Love.

1033
01:08:54,345 --> 01:08:56,515
Do you even know what love is, Frances?

1034
01:08:56,584 --> 01:08:58,838
Well, I know it's not
an answer to anything.

1035
01:08:59,788 --> 01:09:01,454
But love is a witness.

1036
01:09:02,508 --> 01:09:04,049
Reggie sees me.

1037
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,211
And I see him.

1038
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,144
And who are you to refuse that?

1039
01:09:11,031 --> 01:09:12,657
I'm your mother.

1040
01:09:16,115 --> 01:09:20,281
Ey. East End starlet, Frances.

1041
01:09:20,273 --> 01:09:21,414
That's you.

1042
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:22,727
Thank you.

1043
01:09:45,203 --> 01:09:47,577
Oh, Ron, look at her.

1044
01:09:49,164 --> 01:09:51,082
She looks beautiful.

1045
01:09:54,165 --> 01:09:55,266
Enjoy yourself.

1046
01:10:01,329 --> 01:10:02,494
Gracious God...

1047
01:10:02,608 --> 01:10:05,859
accept our prayers for
Frances and Reginald...

1048
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:08,640
that they may reap the
harvest of the Spirit...

1049
01:10:08,689 --> 01:10:12,609
and reflect your glory
through Christ Jesus our lord.

1050
01:10:12,611 --> 01:10:14,989
Amen.
Amen

1051
01:10:35,258 --> 01:10:36,676
Fucking... sing.

1052
01:10:48,704 --> 01:10:50,537
<i>We honeymooned in Greece.</i>

1053
01:10:50,943 --> 01:10:54,738
<i>The Parthenon had stood for two
thousand, four hundred years.</i>

1054
01:10:54,746 --> 01:10:57,997
<i>Reggie's promise to go straight
lasted two weeks.</i>

1055
01:10:59,224 --> 01:11:00,725
Two Aces...

1056
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:03,130
New Mill...

1057
01:11:03,546 --> 01:11:04,884
the Gigi Club...

1058
01:11:04,987 --> 01:11:06,700
and let's not forget Ronnie Scott.

1059
01:11:06,787 --> 01:11:09,790
And this is the bearer
bond cash in Hamburg.

1060
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,228
The kettle's on the boil.

1061
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:17,132
It is tea.

1062
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:20,708
We started out near Marble
Arch in West London.

1063
01:11:20,754 --> 01:11:22,756
But we both missed the East End.

1064
01:11:22,832 --> 01:11:25,835
And so we took an empty flat
below Ron's at Cedra Court.

1065
01:11:26,075 --> 01:11:28,745
Like all else in life it was
supposed to be temporary.

1066
01:11:29,474 --> 01:11:31,228
Not very clever.

1067
01:11:32,597 --> 01:11:34,515
Ron's parties would keep me awake at night.

1068
01:11:34,599 --> 01:11:37,602
And clubland kept Reggie
out until all hours.

1069
01:11:37,879 --> 01:11:40,506
He enjoyed being a gangster, after all.
We heard

1070
01:11:40,411 --> 01:11:43,153
that you, uh, were down the
Regency the other night.

1071
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,554
Waving a shotgun.

1072
01:11:50,201 --> 01:11:53,412
Those bastard Barry brothers
blocked me from coming in.

1073
01:11:54,365 --> 01:11:55,699
They said I was drunk.

1074
01:11:55,806 --> 01:11:58,432
You were!
You was drunk as a skunk.

1075
01:11:58,488 --> 01:11:59,861
Waving a shotgun.

1076
01:12:03,365 --> 01:12:04,788
No.

1077
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:08,210
Now you know we look after that place.

1078
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:09,391
Right?

1079
01:12:09,888 --> 01:12:12,474
We don't want you messing
around down there.

1080
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:14,895
I spiced the evening up for people, y'know?

1081
01:12:16,572 --> 01:12:18,406
Spiced it up.

1082
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:20,299
Here you go.

1083
01:12:30,136 --> 01:12:32,514
You're not going to do
that anymore, are you?

1084
01:12:33,097 --> 01:12:34,346
No, sir.

1085
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:36,203
Good lad.

1086
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:40,237
Oh, bollocks.

1087
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,166
Go on, get up, Jack. Fuck.

1088
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,422
This is so kind of you.

1089
01:12:44,502 --> 01:12:46,460
Sweet, isn't it?
Lovely, yeah.

1090
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,235
Oh, hello.

1091
01:12:51,675 --> 01:12:53,058
Oh, uh...

1092
01:12:54,024 --> 01:12:56,567
Is that OK??
No, no.

1093
01:12:56,625 --> 01:13:00,044
No, Frances, that wo...
that won't do. Umm...

1094
01:13:02,426 --> 01:13:04,888
Go and sit with Mr. Kray
and I'll sort it out.

1095
01:13:04,949 --> 01:13:06,074
Alright.

1096
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:16,228
She can't even make a decent cup of tea.

1097
01:13:17,072 --> 01:13:18,405
Yeah, poor Reggie. ey?

1098
01:13:19,592 --> 01:13:21,053
It was a good effort.

1099
01:13:22,995 --> 01:13:25,786
She looks like a budgie in
that dress, doesn't she?

1100
01:13:26,114 --> 01:13:29,577
You reckon that a man wouldn't pick her
up if she was laying in the gutter.

1101
01:13:30,387 --> 01:13:32,922
Yeah.- Oh well.

1102
01:13:33,197 --> 01:13:35,615
Poor Reggie. Right, I swear...

1103
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:36,780
I shall flush that.

1104
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,553
<i>I left without saying goodbye.</i>

1105
01:13:41,118 --> 01:13:42,535
<i>A sad victory.</i>

1106
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,570
<i>I'd never be good enough
for their Reggie.</i>

1107
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,154
<i>He was Nipper's Reggie as well.</i>

1108
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,842
<i>Reed couldn't rest unless he clapped
eyes on my husband once a day.</i>

1109
01:13:53,003 --> 01:13:55,173
<i>I often had to settle for the same.</i>

1110
01:13:55,366 --> 01:13:59,370
Wherever you're going,
don't stop until you get to the sea.

1111
01:13:59,407 --> 01:14:01,409
<i>But we all need something.</i>

1112
01:14:01,485 --> 01:14:04,780
<i>What I shared with Ron
was needing pills to get through the day.</i>

1113
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:08,851
<i>Sleeping pills helped sometimes,
other pills helped other times.</i>

1114
01:14:09,248 --> 01:14:11,502
<i>They were like a friend who
held no judgment...</i>

1115
01:14:11,568 --> 01:14:13,738
<i>and only wanted to be loved
in return.</i>

1116
01:14:14,292 --> 01:14:15,957
<i>Mother's little helpers.</i>

1117
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:18,052
<i>They were very well named.</i>

1118
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,750
Don't go too fast.

1119
01:14:25,854 --> 01:14:29,025
We're not going anywhere like too fast.
We're in the grass.

1120
01:14:29,376 --> 01:14:30,961
Alright, almost there.

1121
01:14:31,054 --> 01:14:32,348
Alright?
A bit more...

1122
01:14:32,964 --> 01:14:34,976
OK?- OK.

1123
01:14:34,858 --> 01:14:37,777
You ready?
Yes. Really ready? Yes.

1124
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,006
Oh my God.

1125
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:42,786
Do you like it?

1126
01:14:42,901 --> 01:14:45,235
Yes, what... what kind is it?
What's it called?

1127
01:14:45,302 --> 01:14:48,345
It's uh, it's a Triumph. It's a Spitfire.
Triumph Spitfire. Can I get in?

1128
01:14:48,382 --> 01:14:51,970
Yeah, of course you can, it's yours.
Happy Birthday. Here y'are.

1129
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:55,416
Happy Birthday, Frances.
Thank you.

1130
01:14:55,785 --> 01:14:57,663
Will you teach me how to drive?

1131
01:14:58,363 --> 01:15:00,388
Uhhh, I can.

1132
01:15:00,467 --> 01:15:03,971
Now?
Umm... not today.

1133
01:15:04,747 --> 01:15:05,916
Why not?

1134
01:15:06,787 --> 01:15:08,789
I... uh... just can't... not today.

1135
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:14,262
But I can tomorrow.
Alright.

1136
01:15:14,269 --> 01:15:15,438
Sorry.

1137
01:15:24,252 --> 01:15:25,585
Kray.

1138
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:27,833
Kray.

1139
01:15:28,493 --> 01:15:33,122
There's an inherent threat
in that one commanding syllable.

1140
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,261
It's the only word
some need to hear.

1141
01:15:35,815 --> 01:15:38,065
What's that mean? The only word?

1142
01:15:38,335 --> 01:15:40,630
Well, you're like Ford.

1143
01:15:40,698 --> 01:15:41,907
Oh yeah. Or Shell.

1144
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,769
Or Woolworth's.

1145
01:15:44,059 --> 01:15:48,271
Woolworth's. Yes, that's... uh...
that's very interesting.

1146
01:15:48,262 --> 01:15:51,766
What I'm saying is Kray is a brand...

1147
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:55,994
and an established reputation
means less maintenance, less violence.

1148
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:58,194
Y'know? People fall, actually, into line.

1149
01:15:58,265 --> 01:16:00,600
Clubs are asking for our protection
before we even offer it.

1150
01:16:00,667 --> 01:16:03,626
Yeah, that's true, actually.
They, uh, yes..

1151
01:16:03,747 --> 01:16:06,458
I suppose that would leave us with
less straightening out to do.

1152
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:08,721
He's right.

1153
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:10,760
Makes sense.

1154
01:16:11,312 --> 01:16:13,438
See, but I happen to like...

1155
01:16:13,509 --> 01:16:15,888
I like straightening out, y'know?
Once in a while...

1156
01:16:15,953 --> 01:16:18,039
obliging someone to the old cobbles, ey?

1157
01:16:18,112 --> 01:16:19,366
Whats wrong with that?

1158
01:16:19,476 --> 01:16:22,311
I just think you could
do better, Ron, y'know.

1159
01:16:22,914 --> 01:16:25,878
It will keep you out of prison. I mean,
none of us are getting any younger.

1160
01:16:25,918 --> 01:16:28,168
Y'know, you need to leave
this all behind you, I mean.

1161
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:31,197
Y'know, you've got to look to the future,
you and that lovely young wife of yours.

1162
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:33,033
Fairy tales!

1163
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:34,663
That's fucking water.

1164
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:37,220
This is a firm, right? I'm a fucking face.

1165
01:16:37,282 --> 01:16:38,700
Are you alright, mate? Can you see?

1166
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:41,181
I'll fucking serve you
up, you fucking cunt.

1167
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:43,515
Fucking bent out of order!

1168
01:16:43,605 --> 01:16:45,280
I don't fucking like him.
I don't trust him.

1169
01:16:45,224 --> 01:16:46,873
He talks too much, ask
too many questions.

1170
01:16:46,967 --> 01:16:48,384
I want him fucking dead.

1171
01:16:48,488 --> 01:16:51,363
Leslie Payne, right, is our business, mate,
and you want him dead?

1172
01:16:51,408 --> 01:16:52,796
It's... I mean, have
you been taking your

1173
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:54,314
tablets?- Fuck tablets, right?
Bugger tablets.

1174
01:16:54,408 --> 01:16:58,412
Bugger Payne, the fucking... pain
in the ass and fuck his briefcase.

1175
01:16:58,411 --> 01:17:01,747
I don't give a fuck what's in there. I
want to know what's going on up there.

1176
01:17:06,014 --> 01:17:08,893
He knows too much about... things.

1177
01:17:08,937 --> 01:17:12,188
Things about us, Reggie.
He knows too many things about us.

1178
01:17:12,218 --> 01:17:13,635
He knows too many things about us?

1179
01:17:13,739 --> 01:17:16,282
Right, Albie, do you know
things about us, ey?

1180
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,050
You know things, ey?

1181
01:17:18,261 --> 01:17:20,512
About Ron... about me,
about the firm, right?

1182
01:17:20,581 --> 01:17:22,415
You know about... about payments, right?

1183
01:17:22,502 --> 01:17:23,919
Do you know that we cash
bearer bonds, yeah?

1184
01:17:24,024 --> 01:17:27,359
Do you know we pay off juries to make them
look fucking favorably upon us, do you?

1185
01:17:27,385 --> 01:17:28,566
Yes.

1186
01:17:28,783 --> 01:17:32,455
You do. There's a fucking surprise. Jack,
mate, do you know anything about fraud?

1187
01:17:32,468 --> 01:17:33,757
Anything at all. Take a punt.

1188
01:17:33,865 --> 01:17:36,525
Do you know anything about
how we pay off policemen

1189
01:17:36,429 --> 01:17:38,639
every fucking final
Thursday of the month.

1190
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:40,668
Do you know that?
Course I do.

1191
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:43,461
Fucking surprise, that. So
why don't we kill Jack, now?

1192
01:17:43,512 --> 01:17:46,347
Or we do Albie as well?
We'll do the fucking lot.

1193
01:17:46,393 --> 01:17:49,104
Or you can do me and I'll do you,
then we're both fucking dead.

1194
01:17:49,152 --> 01:17:50,446
That's a genius idea.

1195
01:17:50,554 --> 01:17:53,513
Listen to yourself, Ron.
You're fucking nuts.

1196
01:17:57,957 --> 01:18:02,922
People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones.

1197
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,907
Did you know I never drank gin
until I came here?

1198
01:18:07,961 --> 01:18:10,880
Oh, well next you'll be singing
God Save the Queen, won't ya?

1199
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:14,941
What did you want to have a
word with me about, Mr. Bruno?

1200
01:18:15,083 --> 01:18:17,794
Well things are going well,
we're very happy on my side of the pond.

1201
01:18:18,007 --> 01:18:20,510
Well that's good. Y'know,
we're very, very happy also.

1202
01:18:21,045 --> 01:18:22,339
OK.

1203
01:18:22,686 --> 01:18:23,855
Cheers.

1204
01:18:24,888 --> 01:18:26,097
Cheers.

1205
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:29,237
Do you realize that I asked
to speak to you alone?

1206
01:18:30,412 --> 01:18:32,830
You see, in our line of work...

1207
01:18:34,134 --> 01:18:35,968
it is not good to be famous.

1208
01:18:36,693 --> 01:18:38,695
Anonymous is the goal.

1209
01:18:40,815 --> 01:18:42,609
It's Mr. Lansky, Reg.

1210
01:18:42,935 --> 01:18:45,230
He sees a lot of potential in you.

1211
01:18:45,536 --> 01:18:47,875
But he sees limitations
in your brother Ron.

1212
01:18:48,179 --> 01:18:50,221
Well, yeah. Maybe... maybe...

1213
01:18:50,299 --> 01:18:52,292
they could just sit down and
meet each other. Couldn't they?

1214
01:18:52,259 --> 01:18:55,514
I mean, he could come across for a chat.
A chat?

1215
01:18:56,462 --> 01:18:58,464
You guys crack me up, really.

1216
01:18:59,904 --> 01:19:03,161
You ever hear of the Gallo brothers?
From Brooklyn? No.

1217
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:05,684
Similar loose cannon situation.

1218
01:19:06,147 --> 01:19:07,608
You see, Ron is your Joey.

1219
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:10,691
And it's not going to end
well in either case.

1220
01:19:14,952 --> 01:19:17,787
What exactly are you asking
me to do, Mr. Bruno?

1221
01:19:18,633 --> 01:19:21,051
I'm asking you to do something about Ron.

1222
01:19:23,596 --> 01:19:25,430
I can't do that.

1223
01:19:26,715 --> 01:19:28,341
He's my brother.

1224
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:31,808
OK.

1225
01:20:14,456 --> 01:20:15,601
There's nothing I can do.

1226
01:20:15,615 --> 01:20:16,824
I ain't finished with you, yet.

1227
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:20,525
Mr. Kray takes care of this warehouse.
Now you say Kray one more time...

1228
01:20:21,778 --> 01:20:24,365
and I'm gonna hurt you, you understand?

1229
01:20:24,659 --> 01:20:26,164
I have an arrangement with Mr.
Kray. - I

1230
01:20:26,114 --> 01:20:27,853
didn't ask you whether
you had an arrangement.

1231
01:20:27,944 --> 01:20:30,486
I asked if you understood me.

1232
01:20:30,702 --> 01:20:32,872
<i>The Richardson gang were away.</i>

1233
01:20:32,945 --> 01:20:35,370
<i>But George Cornell had
crossed the river to work</i>

1234
01:20:35,283 --> 01:20:37,183
<i>the protection racket
on their behalf.</i>

1235
01:20:37,705 --> 01:20:40,292
I fucking warned you.

1236
01:20:40,348 --> 01:20:43,644
<i>Ron's response would secure his place
in gangster legend.</i>

1237
01:20:43,668 --> 01:20:45,595
What is that? Is that
English breakfast tea? You

1238
01:20:45,528 --> 01:20:47,429
can tell by your face,
Ted, what you think of it.

1239
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:51,181
Lovely box, innit. It is not an
English breakfast, that's not, no.

1240
01:20:51,394 --> 01:20:54,313
That's got pheromones in it, that's got.

1241
01:20:54,912 --> 01:20:56,374
That's musky.

1242
01:20:56,556 --> 01:20:58,975
That's best bit of magic, that is.

1243
01:20:59,715 --> 01:21:01,509
That's very beautiful, innit?

1244
01:21:01,597 --> 01:21:04,308
I'm glad you like it.
I do... that's... that's proper.

1245
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:07,186
Me mum will be very,
very pleased with that.

1246
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,473
Do you have that away from
the old warehouse, did

1247
01:21:09,394 --> 01:21:11,818
ya?- Yeah.- Don't say anything,
I mean, it's alright.

1248
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:14,175
Goes to Mrs. Kray.
Thank you.

1249
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:15,385
And the other matter.

1250
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:17,738
Yeah, what matter?

1251
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:28,573
What, that?
Yeah

1252
01:21:28,769 --> 01:21:29,938
Right...

1253
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:34,141
I mean, I'm not in the mind
to hand out refunds, am I?

1254
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:39,369
Can't you handle it yourself?

1255
01:21:40,294 --> 01:21:42,757
I pay you for protection, Ron.

1256
01:21:46,498 --> 01:21:47,663
What are you trying to say?

1257
01:21:48,215 --> 01:21:51,386
Nothing... You just said it, didn't you?
You fucking said it.

1258
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:55,033
You come in here with
your fucking nose, right?

1259
01:21:55,219 --> 01:21:56,428
And your tea.

1260
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:58,666
Your fucking exotic tea.

1261
01:21:58,742 --> 01:22:01,412
Right? And you say that.

1262
01:22:01,623 --> 01:22:03,749
I'm not very good at my job.

1263
01:22:03,824 --> 01:22:06,619
I didn't mean it like that.
You fucking did.

1264
01:22:07,466 --> 01:22:08,760
No, I...
Uh!

1265
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:10,643
I'll tell you what.

1266
01:22:11,508 --> 01:22:13,510
This matter of yours...

1267
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:17,048
I'll deal with it for you. Alright?

1268
01:22:17,071 --> 01:22:22,661
You go with Teddy, right,
and you bring me two thousand pounds, OK?

1269
01:22:22,994 --> 01:22:28,248
And in return, I promise that I
will have George Cornell killed.

1270
01:22:29,033 --> 01:22:30,286
Alright?

1271
01:22:30,473 --> 01:22:32,187
I didn't say...
Alright?

1272
01:22:32,437 --> 01:22:36,817
I didn't saying anything about
killing, Ron. You fucking did!

1273
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,787
You fucking meant it.
Look at you, you meant it with your eyes.

1274
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,089
Look at your eyes.

1275
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,286
Ey? It's in your fucking eyes.

1276
01:22:43,363 --> 01:22:45,281
Are you threatening me?
No.

1277
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:47,655
Cos there is death in your eyes
and you're fucking threatening me.

1278
01:22:47,723 --> 01:22:50,041
Is he threatening me?
It's hard to tell, Ron.

1279
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:51,184
I'll pay.
You what?

1280
01:22:51,196 --> 01:22:54,584
I'll pay. You will? Yeah.
There it is. And a deal is a deal.

1281
01:22:54,607 --> 01:22:55,708
It's done.
Yeah.

1282
01:22:55,725 --> 01:22:58,856
It's done. It's over.
Teddy, take him.

1283
01:22:59,566 --> 01:23:00,860
Thank you.

1284
01:23:00,969 --> 01:23:02,679
Very kind of you...

1285
01:23:02,771 --> 01:23:05,021
Thank you -
for the tea.

1286
01:23:07,973 --> 01:23:09,722
That's a good deal.

1287
01:23:29,539 --> 01:23:31,041
How do I look?

1288
01:23:31,902 --> 01:23:33,528
Fucking deadly.

1289
01:23:34,584 --> 01:23:36,586
You want me to come in with you?

1290
01:23:37,584 --> 01:23:39,130
In there?

1291
01:23:41,226 --> 01:23:42,604
Come on.

1292
01:23:43,428 --> 01:23:45,346
You'll stay in the car.

1293
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:49,380
Anything you need to tell me?

1294
01:23:56,312 --> 01:23:58,190
Well look what the cat dragged in.

1295
01:23:59,036 --> 01:24:00,245
Jesus.

1296
01:24:04,157 --> 01:24:06,536
Yeah, you're not laughing now, are you?

1297
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,282
For fuck's sake.

1298
01:24:10,918 --> 01:24:12,211
Boss? The fuck?

1299
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,025
Get off the phone.

1300
01:24:17,484 --> 01:24:19,066
Shut up, you heard.

1301
01:24:19,163 --> 01:24:20,873
What are you fucking looking at?

1302
01:24:20,964 --> 01:24:22,550
You didn't see nothing.

1303
01:24:28,087 --> 01:24:30,049
That's Ronnie Kray, that is, innit?

1304
01:24:30,127 --> 01:24:31,588
Fucking hell.

1305
01:24:45,294 --> 01:24:46,698
Reggie.

1306
01:24:47,775 --> 01:24:49,609
Are you mad?

1307
01:24:50,857 --> 01:24:52,526
The Blind Beggar, yeah? Cornell?

1308
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,113
It's on the fucking radio.

1309
01:24:55,221 --> 01:24:56,594
Reggie.

1310
01:24:57,821 --> 01:24:58,922
Hi, Mum.

1311
01:25:00,902 --> 01:25:02,696
Oh, thank you, cheers.

1312
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:05,768
Oh, look at you!

1313
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:09,235
Look how handsome you are.

1314
01:25:11,067 --> 01:25:13,526
I'll get you a cup of tea.
Thanks, Mum.

1315
01:25:13,588 --> 01:25:16,006
Albie? I'm all right, Violet.
Thank you.

1316
01:25:21,709 --> 01:25:23,503
You do look lovely, Reg.

1317
01:25:25,512 --> 01:25:28,847
How many witnesses?
Well, it was a quiet night.

1318
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,044
Seven.
Seven?

1319
01:25:31,113 --> 01:25:32,530
Albert Woods was with Cornell.

1320
01:25:32,635 --> 01:25:34,681
Plus five regulars.
I don't know them.

1321
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:38,094
And that barmaid, the blonde? The one
with the big fucking pair of eyes.

1322
01:25:38,117 --> 01:25:39,302
Fuck's sake.

1323
01:25:39,319 --> 01:25:42,030
And you bring this here? This is where you
bring it? You bring it straight to mums?

1324
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:45,954
Don't moan about it, right? It's done,
innit? What are we going to do? Hmm?

1325
01:25:46,802 --> 01:25:48,676
We?
Yeah.

1326
01:25:54,563 --> 01:25:55,900
Where's the weapon?

1327
01:25:56,164 --> 01:25:57,542
It's here, Reg.

1328
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:05,161
There you go. Now, uh... would
you like a piece of cake?

1329
01:26:05,127 --> 01:26:07,882
You know what? That would be lovely.
So... yeah. Thank you, mum.

1330
01:26:07,931 --> 01:26:11,391
It is. It's lovely.
Thanks.

1331
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:15,289
They've seen you wearing
those clothes, right?

1332
01:26:15,373 --> 01:26:18,752
Yeah. Yeah.
So where's his jacket?

1333
01:26:19,533 --> 01:26:20,718
Right, you need to burn that.

1334
01:26:20,737 --> 01:26:23,199
And that gun, we need to toss it
in the river right fucking now.

1335
01:26:23,456 --> 01:26:24,834
Alright? Go on, fuck off.

1336
01:26:29,604 --> 01:26:32,349
You're... uh... you're unbelievable.

1337
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:37,349
Albie? Whoever was in that pub, we have
to find out who they are, alright?

1338
01:26:37,344 --> 01:26:40,471
And get hold of them and just unravel
whatever they've said to the police.

1339
01:26:40,707 --> 01:26:43,084
Right, what we want to do is get Pat and
Bender and send them down in there.

1340
01:26:43,144 --> 01:26:44,437
That bartender I know her, right?
You know her?

1341
01:26:44,547 --> 01:26:46,757
Alright, well, bring her to me.
I'll deal with her myself.

1342
01:26:46,829 --> 01:26:48,247
Alright? Go on, fuck off.

1343
01:26:48,951 --> 01:26:52,453
Oh, where is everybody going?

1344
01:26:53,029 --> 01:26:55,716
Oh, mum, it's late. It's late. I
wanted them out of your hair, y'know.

1345
01:26:55,641 --> 01:26:57,758
You should get some bedtime.

1346
01:26:57,793 --> 01:26:59,587
Why don't I give you a life home? Come on.

1347
01:27:00,194 --> 01:27:02,236
Oh, it's alright. I am home.

1348
01:27:03,156 --> 01:27:06,075
I've made the bed up for him.
He's not well.

1349
01:27:08,034 --> 01:27:09,664
He's, uh... He's got a fever.

1350
01:27:10,878 --> 01:27:12,712
He's gonna stay here tonight.

1351
01:27:13,721 --> 01:27:16,888
Teddy, you like to stay with him?

1352
01:27:19,241 --> 01:27:21,868
Thanks, that would be very nice.
Thank you, Violet.

1353
01:27:28,085 --> 01:27:30,087
Whatever he's done...

1354
01:27:31,565 --> 01:27:33,567
He's your brother.

1355
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:43,580
Yeah.

1356
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:47,904
Well, ummm...

1357
01:27:48,453 --> 01:27:50,415
Here's your Stemetil, mate.

1358
01:27:51,096 --> 01:27:53,098
You should take that.

1359
01:27:55,457 --> 01:27:58,460
Do you know what? I'm going
to have to go, actually.

1360
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:00,498
I left the lads at work...

1361
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,485
and I have to clean up.

1362
01:28:03,259 --> 01:28:06,346
So I'm going to say g'night.
G'night.

1363
01:28:09,663 --> 01:28:12,919
Teddy, couldn't do us a favor?
Could you be useful?

1364
01:28:12,944 --> 01:28:14,822
When you takes his pantses off tonight...

1365
01:28:14,907 --> 01:28:16,999
and his shirt... can you burn them?

1366
01:28:16,947 --> 01:28:18,532
Yeah, and check in with me?

1367
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:20,339
- Yeah.
- Good lad.

1368
01:28:21,468 --> 01:28:23,138
Night, mum.

1369
01:28:23,228 --> 01:28:24,481
Night.

1370
01:28:29,632 --> 01:28:31,258
He's lovely, isn't he?

1371
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:40,693
<i>Not even Scotland Yard could ignore
murder on the street.</i>

1372
01:28:40,715 --> 01:28:42,717
<i>Nipper was back on the case.</i>

1373
01:28:42,798 --> 01:28:45,092
Gentlemen, your attention please.

1374
01:28:45,997 --> 01:28:50,001
Now you've been told that we are
conducting a high-level investigation...

1375
01:28:50,001 --> 01:28:52,463
into a major corruption allegation.

1376
01:28:52,681 --> 01:28:57,979
In fact, we're going down into
the sewer after the Krays.

1377
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:04,213
Any man with any objection...
come and see me.

1378
01:29:07,607 --> 01:29:09,985
See that lamppost up there, right?

1379
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:12,925
That was known as the safety
point during the war, right?

1380
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:14,515
So if you could run to that lamppost...

1381
01:29:14,611 --> 01:29:16,914
You knew that you could
make it to the air raid

1382
01:29:16,832 --> 01:29:18,857
shelter before the bombs
started dropping.

1383
01:29:20,296 --> 01:29:24,717
One night, right, me and Ron, we
just stood there and we watched.

1384
01:29:25,136 --> 01:29:28,640
And we saw the old Stanton House get
blown to bits. They were still in it.

1385
01:29:29,178 --> 01:29:31,012
It's a wonder you lived through it.

1386
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:33,725
Yeah... yeah, especially Ron, y'know.

1387
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:37,032
Every time trouble came on top, he was
always dragging behind, innit he?

1388
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:40,424
Well, he's got plenty of trouble now
if the stories are true.

1389
01:29:41,744 --> 01:29:43,747
I heard it on the street, Reggie.

1390
01:29:43,826 --> 01:29:46,368
My own family
and you didn't tell me.

1391
01:29:46,427 --> 01:29:49,093
Yeah, well, y'know, I didn't
want you to worry, did I?

1392
01:29:49,147 --> 01:29:52,365
I don't worry about Ron.
What are you planning to do about it?

1393
01:29:52,268 --> 01:29:54,813
I can't let him go to prison, am I
Why not? Why not?

1394
01:29:56,231 --> 01:29:58,482
Why not? Because he's my
brother, that's why not.

1395
01:29:58,551 --> 01:30:01,386
He'll still be your brother in prison.
No.

1396
01:30:01,632 --> 01:30:04,303
No, Frances, look. He belongs
here, right, he belongs with us.

1397
01:30:04,352 --> 01:30:07,399
He belongs to you, me and his family.
This is his home, alright?

1398
01:30:07,434 --> 01:30:09,257
Y'know, I've been looking
after him since we

1399
01:30:09,194 --> 01:30:10,906
were little boys. It's
just the way it is.

1400
01:30:10,995 --> 01:30:13,333
You can still look after him in prison.

1401
01:30:13,838 --> 01:30:15,840
And he doesn't belong
here, and you know it.

1402
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:17,904
Right.

1403
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:21,777
Right. Well, you just don't understand.

1404
01:30:22,082 --> 01:30:24,168
Yes, I do. No, you don't. You
don't understand. Yes, I do.

1405
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,272
You once told me that you
don't owe the world a

1406
01:30:26,202 --> 01:30:28,246
thing. Well you don't owe
Ron a thing, either.

1407
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:32,286
My loyalty for my brother is how I
measure myself, do you understand?

1408
01:30:32,327 --> 01:30:34,786
What about your loyalty to me?
Is that not a measure?

1409
01:30:36,288 --> 01:30:39,083
So... what is going on
with your eyes right now?

1410
01:30:39,127 --> 01:30:40,381
Are you on something?

1411
01:30:40,491 --> 01:30:41,724
Are you taking something, Frances?
Are you taking...

1412
01:30:41,698 --> 01:30:42,838
you taking pills again? Is
that what you're doing?

1413
01:30:42,931 --> 01:30:44,348
Let's have a look.

1414
01:30:44,451 --> 01:30:46,161
No, stop it.
Oh hello, look at that.

1415
01:30:46,253 --> 01:30:48,712
Jesus Christ, Frances, how many
of these things are you on, ey?

1416
01:30:48,854 --> 01:30:50,151
No wonder you're not
making any sense.

1417
01:30:50,122 --> 01:30:51,951
You're popping pills everywhere.
You're a pill-popper.

1418
01:30:52,016 --> 01:30:54,248
And who made me that?
What? A pillpopper?

1419
01:30:56,337 --> 01:30:59,534
So let me get this straight. What
you're saying is that in order

1420
01:30:59,429 --> 01:31:02,526
for us all to be free, yeah, that
we all have to be on our own?

1421
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:06,411
That's great, Frances. That's...
I'll go with that.

1422
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:09,504
Listen... talk to that barmaid.
Yeah?

1423
01:31:09,542 --> 01:31:11,719
Tell her when they line the
suspects up across from

1424
01:31:11,642 --> 01:31:13,874
her to point the finger at
Ron and say, "That's him."

1425
01:31:13,944 --> 01:31:15,778
"That's the man had to
ought to have done it."

1426
01:31:15,865 --> 01:31:17,034
Alright?

1427
01:31:18,704 --> 01:31:21,042
Where are you going?
Home.

1428
01:31:21,827 --> 01:31:23,161
What about me mum?

1429
01:31:23,268 --> 01:31:25,270
Fuck your mum!

1430
01:31:49,104 --> 01:31:50,938
Take your time.
No.

1431
01:31:51,705 --> 01:31:53,831
The man who shot Cornell is not here.

1432
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:55,884
Are you sure?

1433
01:31:55,987 --> 01:31:58,574
Yes, I'm sure.

1434
01:31:59,107 --> 01:32:01,362
Please, can someone just take me home?

1435
01:32:12,034 --> 01:32:13,243
Miss.

1436
01:32:17,353 --> 01:32:21,902
I swear it, though. I smelt something...
I don't know what it was.

1437
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:24,462
But I caught funny looks in the court.
The judge...

1438
01:32:25,398 --> 01:32:27,232
I think he stinked, it was.

1439
01:32:27,998 --> 01:32:29,752
Right? Am I right or am I wrong?

1440
01:32:29,838 --> 01:32:31,964
Am I wrong, Reg?

1441
01:32:31,994 --> 01:32:34,436
It goes to show you that you can give a dog
a bad name...

1442
01:32:34,402 --> 01:32:37,861
but when that dog's name is Kray, he
might bite you back. Well done, Ron.

1443
01:32:37,883 --> 01:32:40,093
Justice is done.

1444
01:32:41,363 --> 01:32:42,865
Welcome home.

1445
01:32:44,605 --> 01:32:45,814
To discipline.

1446
01:32:45,926 --> 01:32:47,720
Take one, Vi.
No.

1447
01:32:47,805 --> 01:32:50,143
Give her a pink wafer.

1448
01:32:52,208 --> 01:32:53,961
<i>Somebody has to eat them.</i>

1449
01:33:09,493 --> 01:33:10,995
What did you tell her?

1450
01:33:15,018 --> 01:33:18,438
Yeah, I just said that you might want
to think about your children, y'know?

1451
01:33:21,379 --> 01:33:23,713
I wish I could make you go away.

1452
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:28,669
Well, good luck with that, Frances.
Yeah, good fucking luck with that.

1453
01:34:12,237 --> 01:34:14,199
Holy cameroon.

1454
01:34:15,398 --> 01:34:17,320
The fuck is she doing?

1455
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,590
It surprises me that some
people are still uhh...

1456
01:34:24,601 --> 01:34:26,479
still survive these days.

1457
01:34:26,564 --> 01:34:28,106
See you later, Albie.

1458
01:34:30,687 --> 01:34:33,313
Are you alright?
Yeah, go on.

1459
01:34:35,085 --> 01:34:37,464
Are you alright? You look
like you're struggling there.

1460
01:34:37,647 --> 01:34:39,108
Help me.

1461
01:34:39,330 --> 01:34:42,249
Help you?
Well, what are we doing?

1462
01:34:42,288 --> 01:34:45,583
Help me put the top on.
Well, I'm not sure I can help you, y'know?

1463
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:47,112
Reggie, please, it's going to get ruined.

1464
01:34:47,213 --> 01:34:49,587
I can't, y'know? I'm a club owner.

1465
01:34:49,651 --> 01:34:52,987
Y'know what I mean? I can pick a nice
model, right, and a nice color...

1466
01:34:53,013 --> 01:34:56,348
but I'm not very good at it. I'm
not a mechanic, am I, y'know?

1467
01:34:56,374 --> 01:34:59,878
I'm more of a gangster.
Isn't that right? Yeah?

1468
01:34:59,897 --> 01:35:02,772
Please, help me. Please, help me?
Yeah...

1469
01:35:03,217 --> 01:35:04,386
Please.

1470
01:35:04,856 --> 01:35:06,234
Please, Reggie.

1471
01:35:07,699 --> 01:35:09,701
Alright, let's help you.
Go on then.

1472
01:35:10,499 --> 01:35:11,624
How about that?

1473
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:14,743
That looks a bit fucking
fucked to me, mate.

1474
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:16,798
Speaking of...

1475
01:35:17,745 --> 01:35:19,703
You look like shit and all.

1476
01:35:30,317 --> 01:35:31,170
Yeah...

1477
01:36:03,001 --> 01:36:04,126
What are you doing?

1478
01:36:04,241 --> 01:36:06,035
Reggie, stop it! Stop it!

1479
01:36:12,082 --> 01:36:13,335
Reggie.

1480
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:18,405
Alright. Stop what?

1481
01:36:18,486 --> 01:36:20,612
Reggie, please. Don't. Please don't.

1482
01:36:20,687 --> 01:36:22,481
Please... no.

1483
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:24,695
Please. No!

1484
01:36:24,889 --> 01:36:26,165
Stop it!

1485
01:36:34,132 --> 01:36:37,051
Life goes on without me.

1486
01:36:40,816 --> 01:36:42,317
Where are you going?

1487
01:36:43,854 --> 01:36:45,480
I'm leaving Reggie.

1488
01:36:45,975 --> 01:36:48,646
Oh, that is a shame. He'll
take that very hard.

1489
01:36:49,097 --> 01:36:51,099
Please get out of my way, Ron.

1490
01:36:51,338 --> 01:36:53,384
Unless you'd prefer me to stay.

1491
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,959
Go on, boys.
Go upstairs.

1492
01:37:02,021 --> 01:37:03,442
Would you like me to
help you with your bags?

1493
01:37:03,703 --> 01:37:05,580
No, thank you.
Oh, come on, don't be daft.

1494
01:37:05,663 --> 01:37:09,502
Look at the size of you. Look at
the size of me. C'mon. Come on.

1495
01:37:09,903 --> 01:37:13,198
You know, Frances, sometimes
to achieve greatness...

1496
01:37:13,226 --> 01:37:15,561
You do. You have to cut off a
little piece of yourself...

1497
01:37:15,627 --> 01:37:18,338
No matter how much it hurts in order
to grow. In order to move on.

1498
01:37:18,389 --> 01:37:21,015
It takes courage and I admire that, y'know?

1499
01:37:21,228 --> 01:37:24,107
To be honest, you're
getting out just in time.

1500
01:37:24,309 --> 01:37:26,811
You think so?
Absolutely, yeah.

1501
01:37:26,871 --> 01:37:29,041
There are so many people
that know so much about us.

1502
01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:30,656
Not you, of course.

1503
01:37:32,195 --> 01:37:34,906
Most people hate us.

1504
01:37:35,476 --> 01:37:39,063
Sooner or later someone's going to talk
and that will be it. It'll all be over.

1505
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:41,399
That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

1506
01:37:44,438 --> 01:37:47,357
I think God ought to cut us some
slack, though, don't you think?

1507
01:37:48,721 --> 01:37:50,515
Yeah, I'm sure God will.

1508
01:37:53,361 --> 01:37:56,612
That is, uh... that is bang out of order.

1509
01:37:56,643 --> 01:37:59,353
That's not how we were brought up.
Not at all.

1510
01:38:00,322 --> 01:38:01,492
Ron, I've got to go.

1511
01:38:01,686 --> 01:38:03,187
Yeah, of course you do.

1512
01:38:03,284 --> 01:38:08,418
Listen here, Frances,
alright, we both love him, alright?

1513
01:38:08,366 --> 01:38:10,492
We've both made the effort.

1514
01:38:10,729 --> 01:38:14,149
So we should just have to see what happens
when we get there.

1515
01:38:16,092 --> 01:38:17,314
Where?

1516
01:38:19,772 --> 01:38:20,897
Heaven.

1517
01:38:27,654 --> 01:38:29,071
Goodbye, Ron.

1518
01:38:29,736 --> 01:38:31,193
Goodbye, Frances.

1519
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:34,155
Listen here...

1520
01:38:35,418 --> 01:38:39,378
I always liked you, Frances.
I always did.

1521
01:38:39,658 --> 01:38:43,370
Because you have the ability
to see into the future.

1522
01:38:43,581 --> 01:38:48,294
You do. And that's the same as me.

1523
01:38:48,944 --> 01:38:50,193
Bye, now.

1524
01:39:33,278 --> 01:39:34,571
Hello, Reggie.

1525
01:39:35,241 --> 01:39:36,534
How are you?

1526
01:39:37,042 --> 01:39:38,207
Yeah, you alright, Frank?

1527
01:39:38,321 --> 01:39:41,116
Long time no see, ey?
Yeah, I'm walking straight, y'know?

1528
01:39:41,064 --> 01:39:44,027
Oh yeah?- Yeah.- That's nice, innit?

1529
01:39:44,844 --> 01:39:46,093
That's nice.

1530
01:39:46,604 --> 01:39:47,981
What can I do for you?

1531
01:39:48,966 --> 01:39:50,384
Frances here?

1532
01:39:52,004 --> 01:39:53,846
It's just that, y'know,
I've been outside

1533
01:39:53,783 --> 01:39:55,769
your parent's house the
last couple of weeks.

1534
01:39:55,846 --> 01:39:58,809
They haven't told me that
she left so I, y'know...

1535
01:39:59,288 --> 01:40:02,083
I've been standing underneath
her her window like a fool.

1536
01:40:04,332 --> 01:40:06,959
Yeah, she's here.
Yeah, I know.

1537
01:40:08,453 --> 01:40:10,788
Reggie, I...
What?

1538
01:40:13,294 --> 01:40:16,466
I haven't seen her like
this in a long time.

1539
01:40:17,297 --> 01:40:19,799
She's delicate.
Right.

1540
01:40:19,855 --> 01:40:21,678
Alright. Well you tell
Frances to come out

1541
01:40:21,615 --> 01:40:23,620
here. I want her to come out here.
Go get her.

1542
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,479
Reggie, I'm not going to let you see her, alright.
Don't fuck about.

1543
01:40:27,579 --> 01:40:29,997
Frances, go back inside.
What are you doing?

1544
01:40:29,911 --> 01:40:32,071
Do not worry. It's OK.
Hello, Reggie.

1545
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:34,490
Hello, Frances.

1546
01:40:36,623 --> 01:40:40,166
Have you got a moment?
So that we can chat?

1547
01:40:40,088 --> 01:40:41,942
It's alright.
Are you sure about this?

1548
01:40:43,787 --> 01:40:46,077
Go in, son. Go put a kettle on.

1549
01:40:49,108 --> 01:40:50,609
Frankie, come home.

1550
01:40:51,628 --> 01:40:53,130
I am home.

1551
01:40:54,228 --> 01:40:58,233
At least until I find somewhere else.
I can't go and live with my mum.

1552
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:02,251
Well what can I do to change your mind?

1553
01:41:02,975 --> 01:41:04,412
You can't.

1554
01:41:06,594 --> 01:41:09,557
I've changed my mind about one
thing, though. What's that?

1555
01:41:10,436 --> 01:41:15,233
I do want you to remember me... always.

1556
01:41:15,998 --> 01:41:20,170
That I existed... that I once walked
beside you. What are you on about?

1557
01:41:20,761 --> 01:41:22,263
Frankie, come on.

1558
01:41:23,162 --> 01:41:26,914
I always imagined... I thought that
we might have a child or two, y'know?

1559
01:41:27,761 --> 01:41:30,808
Why?
So you could use them to threaten me?

1560
01:41:30,845 --> 01:41:32,134
No.

1561
01:41:33,042 --> 01:41:34,672
Because I still love you.

1562
01:41:35,367 --> 01:41:38,221
No. No, it's just a thing
you say out of loyalty for

1563
01:41:38,117 --> 01:41:40,712
something that didn't
exist in the first place.

1564
01:41:40,671 --> 01:41:44,568
Not true. Loving you is the only
thing that holds me together.

1565
01:41:49,092 --> 01:41:54,053
Y'know, I dreamt that we could live
beyond the place that we were meant for.

1566
01:41:55,853 --> 01:41:58,832
But you're a gangster
and you love being one.

1567
01:41:58,972 --> 01:42:02,396
No. No, Frances, listen.

1568
01:42:04,297 --> 01:42:09,842
Please let me make amends for the suffering
and the pain that I have cause you. Please.

1569
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:11,585
Please.

1570
01:42:13,539 --> 01:42:15,333
Just let me take you somewhere.

1571
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:20,112
Somewhere?
Yeah, anywhere. Anywhere you want.

1572
01:42:21,141 --> 01:42:23,896
Yeah, just the two of us.
So we can be together.

1573
01:42:25,344 --> 01:42:27,221
It'll be like our second honeymoon.

1574
01:42:27,944 --> 01:42:32,072
Or not. Just so that you can
know that I can change.

1575
01:42:33,507 --> 01:42:36,009
To be fair, I have... I've changed.

1576
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:45,064
All I'm saying is that the center of the
world can be anywhere you want it to be.

1577
01:42:45,392 --> 01:42:46,642
Anywhere.

1578
01:42:47,832 --> 01:42:50,170
Ibiza.
Who?

1579
01:42:50,217 --> 01:42:54,446
Ibiza. Let's go there.
I like the way the word sounds.

1580
01:42:54,435 --> 01:42:57,185
Yeah. You know what? I like
the way the words sounds too.

1581
01:42:57,716 --> 01:43:03,053
You want to go to Ibiza?
I'll get the tickets today. I'll book them today.

1582
01:43:54,216 --> 01:43:57,095
<i>God doesn't ask if we accept this life.</i>

1583
01:43:57,258 --> 01:44:00,721
<i>There is no choice.
Life is forced upon you.</i>

1584
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:06,649
<i>The only choice is how you live it.
Or not. That's a choice as well.</i>

1585
01:44:22,389 --> 01:44:24,592
<i>A cup of tea can solve anything.</i>

1586
01:44:24,948 --> 01:44:30,621
<i>A bit under the weather? Tea. You've left
your husband? Tea is the answer.</i>

1587
01:44:30,552 --> 01:44:33,554
Frances, no Frances. What
have you done? Frances!

1588
01:44:34,071 --> 01:44:36,830
<i>In case you thought, "at
least Frances survived</i>

1589
01:44:36,729 --> 01:44:39,047
<i>or she wouldn't be telling
us this tale."</i>

1590
01:44:39,195 --> 01:44:41,322
<i>Well, now you know.</i>

1591
01:44:41,995 --> 01:44:46,748
<i>But I was free at last.
God finally cut me some slack.</i>

1592
01:44:46,717 --> 01:44:48,135
Where is she?

1593
01:44:49,264 --> 01:44:50,597
In her bedroom.

1594
01:45:50,781 --> 01:45:54,785
<i>That afternoon Reggie would
drink himself insensible.</i>

1595
01:45:55,425 --> 01:45:58,805
<i>What do you do after
all, when the only person</i>

1596
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,294
<i>who could ever get to you is gone?</i>

1597
01:46:01,587 --> 01:46:05,299
<i>A cup of tea?
I don't think so.</i>

1598
01:47:25,453 --> 01:47:27,152
One big hat.

1599
01:47:29,074 --> 01:47:32,807
Go on, sit down. Don't stand around there
looking like some kind of lamppost.

1600
01:47:36,796 --> 01:47:38,009
Squeeze in.

1601
01:47:38,218 --> 01:47:44,175
Sweat it. What don't we have. A bottle.
Go on. Go on, Gordon.

1602
01:47:50,474 --> 01:47:52,924
You wanted to see me, Ron?
Yeah, I do actually.

1603
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:57,324
I want you to kill someone for me, alright?
I'm going to give you a thousand pounds.

1604
01:47:57,619 --> 01:47:58,916
Leslie.

1605
01:48:01,536 --> 01:48:05,052
There's 500 there, right, so that's half.

1606
01:48:05,163 --> 01:48:07,471
Yeah? You get the rest when it's done.

1607
01:48:07,702 --> 01:48:11,891
You count it all, cos it's all there.
And you can put it in your little pocket.

1608
01:48:13,172 --> 01:48:14,638
That's for you.

1609
01:48:15,141 --> 01:48:18,824
Go on, put it in your fucking pocket.
We know you ain't got any money.

1610
01:48:19,453 --> 01:48:20,866
Don't be daft.

1611
01:48:23,857 --> 01:48:25,061
Who is it?

1612
01:48:52,724 --> 01:48:54,381
Mum, wait here.

1613
01:49:04,789 --> 01:49:06,469
Stop, Mum. Leave it.
You killed her.

1614
01:49:06,529 --> 01:49:10,171
You killed my daughter, you bastard.
You killed her.

1615
01:49:11,950 --> 01:49:15,238
<i>Spending a hundred
pounds a week on flowers</i>

1616
01:49:15,116 --> 01:49:17,463
<i>won't bring her back. Murderer.</i>

1617
01:49:17,529 --> 01:49:22,087
<i>You'll fucking rot in hell, Reggie Kray.</i>

1618
01:50:04,084 --> 01:50:06,217
McVitie, what are you doing here?

1619
01:50:06,492 --> 01:50:09,922
I've got a message for you... from Ron.

1620
01:50:20,941 --> 01:50:22,114
Back.

1621
01:50:55,145 --> 01:50:57,823
Shall I send a solicitor
or have you seen to that?

1622
01:51:01,317 --> 01:51:05,201
I want my wife and children's
safety guaranteed.

1623
01:51:16,689 --> 01:51:17,942
Payne.

1624
01:51:18,759 --> 01:51:20,574
He's given them everything.

1625
01:51:20,901 --> 01:51:25,125
Names, dates, times.

1626
01:51:25,397 --> 01:51:27,823
Documents, the lot.

1627
01:51:29,813 --> 01:51:32,029
They'll put two and two together...

1628
01:51:33,169 --> 01:51:35,828
and send a dozen witnesses
into protection.

1629
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:40,631
Nipper, uh...

1630
01:51:43,698 --> 01:51:45,622
Yeah, Nipper, what?

1631
01:51:48,766 --> 01:51:53,493
The barmaid. He got the barmaid back in.

1632
01:51:55,428 --> 01:51:57,174
She ain't coming out.

1633
01:52:02,763 --> 01:52:04,269
Where's Ron?

1634
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:12,029
Oh, yeah.

1635
01:52:17,162 --> 01:52:21,600
This is a piece of of me, this.
Oh yeah. I love this song.

1636
01:52:21,578 --> 01:52:22,882
It's your favorite.

1637
01:52:35,832 --> 01:52:38,680
Oh fuck it, everybody...

1638
01:52:38,811 --> 01:52:40,015
What?

1639
01:52:40,891 --> 01:52:43,903
He still goes through, Ian. Oy.

1640
01:52:44,834 --> 01:52:47,716
What?
Don't get him started.

1641
01:52:48,103 --> 01:52:51,239
Fuck it.
Well, thank you for asking.

1642
01:52:55,549 --> 01:52:59,827
Cheer up, twinkletoes.
It's nearly Christmas.

1643
01:53:00,245 --> 01:53:02,411
Why don't you have a little
dance or something, y'know?

1644
01:53:04,538 --> 01:53:07,016
What is the point of
coming out to a party like

1645
01:53:06,927 --> 01:53:09,417
this... if you're not
going to enjoy yourself?

1646
01:53:10,317 --> 01:53:12,418
I'm waiting for Jack the Hat.

1647
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:16,489
Oh, right. What's he been doing?
Has he been

1648
01:53:16,398 --> 01:53:19,042
waving his shotgun around
in the clubs again?

1649
01:53:19,624 --> 01:53:23,054
What did you think going after
Leslie Payne was going to get us?

1650
01:53:23,138 --> 01:53:26,278
What do I think?
You heard.

1651
01:53:27,297 --> 01:53:32,526
Well in case you ain't realized, I don't
fucking answer to you, sweetheart.

1652
01:53:37,051 --> 01:53:40,238
There he is. Come on. C'mon, Ron, show
us that stuff. I've got the moves.

1653
01:53:42,059 --> 01:53:45,089
Hello, hello. Where the birds at?
It's Jack the Hat.

1654
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:47,820
Mr. Bender, how are ya?
Nice to see you.

1655
01:53:49,277 --> 01:53:50,465
Esther?
Jackie.

1656
01:53:50,448 --> 01:53:53,018
I should never have let you go,
that was an absolute mistake.

1657
01:53:52,938 --> 01:53:55,934
I'm going to get myself a drink.
And then I'm going to come back

1658
01:53:55,824 --> 01:53:58,601
and I'll tell you why I shouldn't
have let you go. Promise.

1659
01:54:05,057 --> 01:54:06,226
Ron.

1660
01:54:13,226 --> 01:54:14,359
Teddy.

1661
01:54:15,353 --> 01:54:20,811
Hang on, Ron, look. Jack's here.
What's your story this morning, Dorice.

1662
01:54:28,970 --> 01:54:33,821
Here, Jack. A cigarette.
I quit on the way down the stairs.

1663
01:54:41,187 --> 01:54:43,395
You got something on your mind, Reg?

1664
01:54:43,788 --> 01:54:47,676
Yeah. Yeah, you're on my mind, mate.

1665
01:54:48,377 --> 01:54:50,050
Leslie Payne?

1666
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:53,762
What the fuck were you thinking?

1667
01:54:55,645 --> 01:54:57,153
Ey? You've ruined this.

1668
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,976
I don't know what you're on about.
Don't fucking lie to me.

1669
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:04,614
I'm not going to fucking
let me be treated this

1670
01:55:04,562 --> 01:55:06,006
way. - How do you want
to be treated, Jack?

1671
01:55:06,010 --> 01:55:08,498
Ron?- Shut up.
He ain't going to fucking help you, is he?

1672
01:55:08,462 --> 01:55:10,317
You've got a tin of worms
in your head, mate.

1673
01:55:10,308 --> 01:55:13,027
Don't take it out on me
what happened to Frances.

1674
01:55:13,656 --> 01:55:14,878
What's that? What did you say?

1675
01:55:15,267 --> 01:55:17,249
It's not my fault
that Frances killed

1676
01:55:17,181 --> 01:55:19,594
herself. I never sold
her the fucking pills.

1677
01:55:19,562 --> 01:55:22,167
Oh, you've got to be joking.
Are you fucking joking? Reggie.

1678
01:55:22,415 --> 01:55:24,001
Go on.
Fucking shoot him.

1679
01:55:24,068 --> 01:55:27,120
Say that again, go on.
Reggie.

1680
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:30,399
Say her fucking name.
I dare you.

1681
01:55:35,681 --> 01:55:37,617
Frances.

1682
01:56:13,956 --> 01:56:16,213
Why would you do that?

1683
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:25,356
Because I can't kill you, no matter
how much I fucking want to.

1684
01:56:54,999 --> 01:56:56,296
<i>Reggie?</i>

1685
01:56:58,859 --> 01:57:01,716
Reggie?

1686
01:57:02,276 --> 01:57:05,675
Reg, look at me.
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1687
01:57:06,018 --> 01:57:10,887
You kill a geezer in a room full of people.
Are you fucking mad?

1688
01:57:12,418 --> 01:57:13,631
Ey?
Ey, what?

1689
01:58:28,025 --> 01:58:31,495
<i>Reggie once said that the center of the
world could be anywhere you like.</i>

1690
01:58:31,739 --> 01:58:34,583
<i>Even here, in the East End of London.</i>

1691
01:58:35,013 --> 01:58:40,730
<i>The world is quite like London. It's not
good. It's not bad. It just is.</i>

1692
01:58:40,948 --> 01:58:45,088
<i>There's no morality or dishonor.
Just your own lonely code...</i>

1693
01:58:44,986 --> 01:58:48,291
<i>until your race is run.
Until the end.</i>

1694
01:58:48,411 --> 01:58:52,343
<i>Until we're all just ghosts of the
people we once thought we were.</i>

1695
01:59:13,038 --> 01:59:16,527
<i>Reggie spent 33 years in prison
for killing Jack McVitie.</i>

1696
01:59:17,105 --> 01:59:22,183
<i>Through all of those years, until the end,
he carried a pair of tickets with him.</i>

1697
01:59:22,296 --> 01:59:27,731
<i>Reggie, my prince. We were supposed
to go to Ibiza, after all.</i>

1698
01:59:29,296 --> 01:59:35,731
